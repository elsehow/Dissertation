1. Introduction and literature review

Essentially a dissertation-chapter-y version of this prospectus. My analysis of key studies will be a bit more fleshed out, and certainly I will include some new theory and papers I don't yet know of. <!-- this should be some kind of pub someday -->

2. Actually measuring

........blurb.........some really fascinating philosophy + technology stuff here

3. Iterated prisoner's dilemma game with heartrate

I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.

4. Vignette experiment with heartrate

This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might "matter" for social behavior. This study serves as a nice springboard FOR.....................

5. Value of biosignals

6. Self-reflective interpretations - HR

7. Self-reflective interpretations - EEG

8. Conclusion & discussion

Not sure what will come here yet but I look forward to finding out. The major idea here is to speak to that question I mention in the introduction bit -- how do biosignals get assigned social meanings? but,
