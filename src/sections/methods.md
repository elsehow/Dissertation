I will perform controlled, lab-based behavioral experiments, as well as survey experiments, in which subjects partake in risky, uncertain interactions with other people (e.g., the money they receive depends on their behavior). Subjects will be exposed, or not exposed, to a biosignal collected from their partner. By introducing signals such as GSR, heart rate and EEG into classic social- behavioral experimental paradigms (e.g., dictator game, iterated prisoner's dilemma game), or into vignette scenarios, we can begin to observe how the presence of biosignals affects social behavior, as compared to control conditions.

Through these studies, I hope to shed some light on how interpretations arise from biosensor data. 
The very big questions here - how these interpretations depend on the sensor, the application context, the phenomenon being sensed - begin to gesture toward the huge mosaic of factors at play in this question. I hope that this very fundamental series of studies opens the dialogue around privacy as they bare on wearable sensors. Data, even raw data that may seem innocuous to end users, can have *contextual* social effects that are far from obvious.

Applications that leverage wearable biosensor data will change the way we relate to our bodies, and to the bodies of others, in ways we do not yet understand.
These studies will provide a limited, but useful starting point for understanding how, why, and when disclosure of biosignals might become relevant. We hope to shed light on how these signals are incorporated into our understandings of the moods, motivations, and goals of other people, which in turn will lay groundwork for a deeper understanding of how wearable data might become sensitive, or might lead to over-disclosure, in different settings and contexts.
