biosensors will enable us to build increasingly high-resolution models of the human physiology, as it exists in the wild, outside of laboratory settings.

there are many reasons why we may want to do this....learn about health, behavior, ...

<!-- but, the proliferation of biosensors also means that biomedical data will go to many stakeholders who have not previously had access to this type of data. ... application designers are now gatekeepers to a whole new class of potentially highly personal data, the "first line" between these and other users, and of corporate interests........... -->
<!-- they could coerce users into giving up that data in a number of ways..... -->


<!-- however, threats around disclosure of biosensory data are abstract, far-off, difficult to reason about. it is not so convincing to stay, "someday, our heartrate data may make your insurace rates go up (even though this may well be the case [@latava_longitudinal]) -->
<!-- these studies could make these threats more concrete.... -->




<!-- (some link ... ?) -->


### MY THESIS
that biosignals can mediate interpsonal interactions in complex, highly contextual ways, and the social outcomes from transmitting biosensor data are far from obvious

we do not know the expressive capacity of biosensors

### MY QUESTION
HOW does context shape the meaning of biosignals
as these signals mediate interpersonal communication




<!-- this is an opportunity AND a challenge, for UX designers -->
<!-- for users, its an opportunity AND a privacy/security challenge -->

<!-- contest surveillance -->
<!-- raise some alarms -->









## stray lines

Biosensing technologies are becoming pervasive in our daily lives, beyond wristwatches and eyeglasses, into clothing, furniture, mirrors, cars, personal robots, ingestibles.

these studies could make these threats more concrete....
