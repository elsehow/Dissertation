## motivation

<!-- biosensing on the rise -->
biosensors will enable us to build increasingly high-resolution models of the human physiology, as it exists in the wild, outside of laboratory settings.

<!-- opportunities -->
there are many reasons why we may want to do this....learn about health, behavior, ... 

<!-- risks -->
BUT, the proliferation of biosensors also means that biomedical data will go to many stakeholders who have not previously had access to this type of data. ...

<!-- low barrier to entry w surveillance -->
the quality that defines surveillance with wearable biosensors is that anyone can play from home. just order some sensors from adafruit, wire them to an arduino, and start a kickstarter - soon enough, you'll be collecting massive bio-datasets of your own (bio big data, as it were).

<!-- onus on the appication designers -->
application designers are now gatekeepers to a whole new class of potentially highly personal data, the "first line" between these and other users, and of corporate interests........... they could coerce users into giving up that data in a number of ways........essentially coerce users into being surveilled in new and potentially scary ways. users have no idea what the data they give up might mean in the near future, when new analyses find new correlations [], with mood, with behavior, with temperment...

meanwhile, forms of consent have a lot to do with the applications offered to user, what they claim to give to users.....

## importance

understanding how to protect users in this new context of collection requries understanding and anticipating situations in which users may be tempted to give their data up
this is a big problem, so a slightly smaller thing to interrogate is: what do people MAKE of physiological data? 
and, even more specifically, 
how do people use physiological data to build interpretations about stuff like mood, state of mind?
how do these signals take on SOCIALLY CONTEXTUAL meanings?

here, we examine a special case of disclosure, by seeing what biosignals mean in social contexts.

<!-- importance: STAKEHOLDERS -->
the idea is 

- to inform UX design (stakeholder 1) - so they can create ethical things

- to understand risks to the end user (stakeholder 2) - so they can reason better about disclosure w/r/t biosignals

- to make ambiguous privacy threats more concrete (threats around disclosure of biosensory data are abstract, far-off, difficult to reason about. it is not so convincing to stay, "someday, our heartrate data may make your insurace rates go up (even though this may well be the case [@latava_longitudinal]). saying, "your heartrate may make you less trustworthy", far more convincing)

- to make a point about the CREEPINESS of this data --- showing that ppl DO make stuff of them, surfacing those meanings in order to draw attention to what sensor companies / economic models are DOING, how they're sucking this data out of you...........

## thesis

### my thesis

biosignals can mediate interpsonal interactions in complex, highly contextual ways, and the social outcomes from transmitting biosensor data are far from obvious

we do not really understand the expressive capacity of biosensors

interrogating this can teach us a lot about how and why people might consent to give up their physiological data
and when they may not...
also could teach people to be more careful about transmittin gthese data, to people or to other entities..

### my questions

how does context shape the meaning of biosignals
as these signals mediate interpersonal communication
?

what are these signals 'worth' to other people?

### my methods

lab-based methods

surveys



<!-- this is an opportunity and a challenge, for ux designers -->
<!-- for users, its an opportunity and a privacy/security challenge -->

<!-- contest surveillance -->
<!-- raise some alarms -->









## stray lines

biosensing technologies are becoming pervasive in our daily lives, beyond wristwatches and eyeglasses, into clothing, furniture, mirrors, cars, personal robots, ingestibles.
