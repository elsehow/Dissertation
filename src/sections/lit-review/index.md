<!-- but wait! there are more fundamental questions here,..... -->
One very relevant question missing from this work is, Why does heartrate help build intimacy? By what mechanism does this effect occur? We might not see the same effect from a stream of, say, your skins weatiness, but why not? 

Most generally, By what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning? How do people build these interpretations in the first place?

In many cases, the mechanisms by which these interfaces work have less to do with the algorithm than they do with the contextual, social, or narrative interpretations that people draw from sensor data. <!-- a whole array of stuff i could talk about here, ubifit garden; meeting mediator; social signals; EEG; --> suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]
