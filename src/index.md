# the social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans encounter and interpret data from wearable biosensors in different social contexts.

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

The Apple Watch	has a heartrate sharing feature.

Now, heartrate has algorithmic meanings; even ones we may not expect [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]. and there are lots of reasons why various parties might be interested in collecting heartrate data. companies and consumers. global push toward mhealth and so on. no huge mystires here. But allowing users to *share* their heartrate socially - .......

	- what is supposed to happen?
	- when are people supposed to use this feature?

The story we're told is that this kind of sharing feature will help foster intimacy between participants, a story that goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003]. The more complicated story [@slovak_understanding_2012] is that the meaning of these signals are primed heavily by SOCIAL CONTEXT - where the signals were exchanged, and who the participants were to each other.

Is there more to biosignal sharing than intimacy? Can these same signals have negative meanings as well as positive ones? What is the social impact of these intepretations?

As sensing devices become more pervasive, as mhealth creeps across the digital globe, these questions have a big impact both for the people who design interactions with sensors, and for the end-users who buy these devices (buy with money and "buy" with mindhsare, give credence to the data)

(And, all of this leads gestures toward, but will not specifically answer: how do these interpretations arise? by what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning?)

## A discussion of the theoretical and/or empirical background area of the student’s proposed dissertation, including analysis of relevant prior work

idea of mediating interpersonal communciation with physiological sensors goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003]

	and what stories were told?

	and did they work? what stories were told about that?

social signalling..... [@goffman_presentation_1959, @bergstrom_social_2009, @bergstrom_conversation_2007, @kim_meeting_2008]

	is it social signalling for all sensor-driven interactions?

NO! suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]

and now i might want to quote dawn nafus at lenght about cultural cohesion etc.

## A detailed discussion of proposed research methods and how they will address the research question

high-level: lab-based behavioral + survey

- lab study 1 (most purely behavioral)

- lab study 2 (takes a little broader view of social exchange)

- lab study 3 (most ecologically avlid)
