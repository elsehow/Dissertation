# the social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans encounter and interpret data from wearable biosensors in different social contexts.

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

The Apple Watch	has a heartrate sharing feature.

Now, heartrate has algorithmic meanings; even ones we may not expect [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]. and there are lots of reasons why various parties might be interested in collecting this type of data. companies and consumers. global push toward mhealth and so on. no huge mystires here. But allowing users to *share* their heartrate socially - .......

	- what is supposed to happen?

	- when are people supposed to use this feature?

The story we're told is that this kind of sharing feature will help foster intimacy between participants, a story that goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003]. The more complicated story [@slovak_understanding_2012] is that the meaning of these signals are primed heavily by SOCIAL CONTEXT - where the signals were exchanged, and who the participants were to each other.

		in fact, in many cases, the mechanisms by which these interfaces work have less to do with the algorithm than they do with the contextual, social, or narrative interpretations that people draw from sensor data. a whole array of things i talk about here, ubifit garden; meeting mediator; social signals; EEG; basically "see below" for that lit story

but, a more fundamental question here is, How does heartrate come to help build intimacy? We might not see the same effect from a stream of, say, your skins weatiness, but why not? By what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning?

fascinating questions, but this dissertation focuses on something with a bit more direct applicability to designers, and end users,

Are the social outcomes of biosignal sharing always going to be positive? 

through three studies, I will explore the contextual meanings of various biosignals in different situations. individual projects will attempt to pinpoint ways in whcih biosignal sharing may yield *uncooperative or anti-social behavioral outcomes*, due to the social context in which data were shared.

As sensing devices become more pervasive, as mhealth creeps across the digital landscape, these questions have a big impact both for the people who design interactions with sensors, and for the end-users who buy these devices (buy with money and "buy" with mindhsare, give credence to the data)...........so we need to be careful of these kinds of bad outcomes

in the meantime, i want for my three investigations to congeal toward a larger picture that gestures toward these first questions --- how do social interpretations arise from biosensor data? how do these data come to take on socially contextual meanings? this question, which is much larger than my dissertation, has bunches of relevance for anyone who wants to design an mHealth app, or incentivize other people to collect biosensor data....etc.

## A discussion of the theoretical and/or empirical background area of the student’s proposed dissertation, including analysis of relevant prior work

idea of mediating interpersonal communciation with physiological sensors goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003]

		*and what stories were told?

		*and did they work? what stories were told about that?

open up here with details hinted at with that first note above. this above graf really just serves as an introduction to the idea itself, this graf would be introduction to the mechanisms by which tehsemeanings work

		and i might want to quote dawn nafus at lenght about cultural cohesion etc.

social signalling..... [@goffman_presentation_1959, @bergstrom_social_2009, @bergstrom_conversation_2007, @kim_meeting_2008]

is it social signalling for all sensor-driven interactions? NO! suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]

## A detailed discussion of proposed research methods and how they will address the research question

		focus down here next time
		what would be fun?
		- suggestion / suggestivity --- interest miner exp
		- affectiva....how does that tie in here?
		- remember: you can do 2 coye studies + IM.....all about, why they make sense together
		what if:
		- 3 lab-based experiments..
		- usability tests of my software (??)
		- just generating alternatives here

high-level: lab-based behavioral + survey

- hr pd xlab study (done)

- hr xlab survey study (done)

- ??   (coye)

- ??    (john/tap,interest-miner)

## A proposed timeline for the student’s proposed dissertation

- Spring 2016: carry out studies 2 + 3

- June 2016: circulate chapter 1 + outline

- September 2017: circulate study-related chapters + updated outline

- December 2017: circulate complete first draft

- May 2017: file 

## Tentative outline

1. Introduction and literature review

Essentially a dissertation-chapter-y version of this prospectus. My analysis of key studies will be a bit more fleshed out, and certainly I will include some new theory and papers I don't yet know of. 

2. Iterated prisoner's dilemma game with heartrate

I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.

3. Vignette experiment with heartrate

This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might "matter" for social behavior. This study serves as a nice springboard FOR.....................

8. Conclusion & discussion

Not sure what will come here yet but I look forward to finding out. The major idea here is to speak to that question I mention in the introduction bit -- how do biosignals get assigned social meanings? but,
