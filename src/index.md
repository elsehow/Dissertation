# pre-prospectus

intro about the rise of biosensing, about the rise of apps that let you share biosignals socially (apple watch, thumbkisses, heartgram) - in these apps, people, rather than algorithms, are supposed to interpret biosensory data

however, it's not well understood how people build interpretations around these data, or what mechanisms give rise to these interpretations. in general, the expressive capacity of biosignals is not well understood. 
<!-- for all these kickstarters trying to make sensor-driven applications, how people actually interpret data from sensors is poorly understood. in most applications (consider xx) we assume that suggestion plays a role. but, what is the role of the sensor itself? the cultural narratives around the body, etc...? -->

## my thesis (slash "hunch")

- biosignals can mediate interpsonal interactions in complex, highly contextual ways

- transmitting biosensor data between individuals causes socal outcomes that are far from obvious.

- raising this issue could heighten awareness around surveillance, and privacy concerns, when it comes to wearable sensors and how they communicate to third parties.

## questions

1. how does context shape the interpretations people build around bioensor data, when these signals are shared socailly?

2. what is the effect of the signal itself on these interpretations? what is the effect of its representation?

3. what are these signals 'worth' to other people? to what extent do people value these data (or not) in different settings?

## questions i gesture toward

1. why do people disclose biosignals?

2. what do people think others can know about them, given their biosignals?

3. how can we help people reason about the consequences of disclosing their biosensor data to others?

### why this topic? why these questions?

data from the body has a complex relationship to "our" world of social meaning

we explore that relationship using social interactions to 'raise the stakes' for connected apps that leverage biosensory data

compared to self-reflective interpretations (which are realatively well-studied anyway), this topic has more of a relationship with surveillance and privacy

## methods

<!-- lifted from CLTC proposal -->
I will perform controlled, lab-based experiments, as well as survey-based vignettes, in which subjects partake in risky, uncertain interactions with other people (e.g., the money they receive depends on their behavior). Subjects will be exposed, or not exposed, to a biosignal collected from their partner. By introducing signals such as GSR, heart rate and EEG into classic social- behavioral experimental paradigms (e.g., dictator game, iterated prisoner's dilemma game), or into vignette scenarios, we can begin to observe how the presence of biosignals affects social behavior, as compared to control conditions.
<!-- 
These studies will provide a limited, but useful starting point for understanding how, why, and when disclosure of biosignals might become relevant. We hope to shed light on how these signals are incorporated into our understandings of the moods, motivations, and goals of other people, which in turn will lay groundwork for a deeper understanding of how wearable data might become sensitive, or might lead to over-disclosure, in different settings and contexts.
 -->

### why these methods?

with these methods, we can establish baseline behaviors relative too well-known findings from social psychology, giving us a better idea for how this information is integrated into social understanding, and how it affects social behavior

## outcomes 

broadly, i'm hoping these findings gesture toward a few interesting questions, all of which are bigger than my particular dissertation:

- to what cultural narratives do these signals & sensors cohere?

- how and why might people consent to giving up their physiological data, to other people, or to other entities? 

### concrete outcomes 

- to inform UX design (stakeholder group 1)

- to understand risks to the end user (stakeholder group 2) 

- to make ambiguous privacy threats more concrete. specifically, to make a point about the CREEPINESS of this data - showing that these data *do* have a "meaning," and surfacing those meanings in order to draw attention to current business / economic models
