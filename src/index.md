# the social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

A lot of work looks at what biosensor data means to algorithms, but what do these data mean to people? 
Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans (rather than algorithms) encounter and interpret biosensor data in social contexts.

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

heartrate in apple watch 
has algorithmic meanings [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]
but im more interested in thumbkisses [@mcnell_who_2015]
what is it that allows this to work? what are the affordances of thumbkisses as opposed to just two circles where you're pressing ont he screen? (higher-resolution models of our bodies in everyday life).

heartrate sharing in everyday life [@slovak_understanding_2012] and how there are social meanings
but how do they arise?
are these meanings always positive?

stakeholders are 
designers +
ppl who "buy" sensor readings.

## A detailed discussion of proposed research methods and how they will address the research question

lab study 1 (most purely behavioral)
lab study 2 (takes a little broader view of social exchange)
lab study 3 (most ecologically avlid)
