# The social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

<!-- write this last -->

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

<!-- Biosensing technologies are becoming pervasive in our daily lives, beyond wristwatches and eyeglasses, into clothing, furniture, mirrors, cars, personal robots, ingestibles.  -->
biosensors will enable us to build increasingly high-resolution models of the human physiology, as it exists in the wild, outside of laboratory settings.

there are many reasons why we may want to do this....health, behavior, science, industry, and so on

<!-- however, the proliferation of biosensors also means that biomedical data will go to many stakeholders who have not previously had access to this type of data.  -->
<!-- and they could coerce users into giving up that data in an umber of ways..... -->
application designers are the new gatekeeprs of medical privacy, the "first line" between these potentially sensitive data and other users
<!-- and other corporate interests.. -->

<!-- however, threats around disclosure of biosensory data are abstract, far-off, difficult to reason about. it is not so convincing to stay, "someday, our heartrate data may make your insurace rates go up (even though this may well be the case [@latava_longitudinal]) -->
these studies could make these threats more concrete....

why we want to study this
<!-- contest surveillance -->
<!-- raise some alarms -->
well, ppl could be coerced to giving otu data by flashy apps
we want to shwo that these data are NOT innocous, necessarily.....
that biosignals can emdiate interpsonal interactions in complex, highly contextual ways, and the social outcomes from transmitting biosensor data are far from obvious

## A discussion of work already completed towards the student’s proposed dissertation

<!-- CHI 2016 work with coye, first exp we did -->

blah blah sum up exp

all this technical stuff so easy now
