# the social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans encounter and interpret data from wearable biosensors in different social contexts. <!-- note: write this last -->

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

<!-- 
	some bit about biosensors
	ADAPT FROM: CLTC proposal
-->

<!--
	data from these biosensors are available to designers
	apple watch, some others
	but what do people make of these data?
	intimacy is the idea in this application.
	is it really as simple as, 'intimacy'?
-->

<!-- 
	in three studies, i will look at
	how people integrate information from biosensors, use it as a sensemaking resource,
		= information about another person
		= information about themselves
	abt non-health stuff - mood,thoughts,emotion
	through these studies, i hope to shed some light on HOW these interpretations arise. 
	the very big question. how they depend on the sensor, the application, the thing being sensed - begin to gesture toward the huge mosaic of factors at play here.
	i hope that this very fundamental series of studies opens the dialogue around privacy w/r/t wearable sensors - data, even raw data that seems innocuous, can have social effects IN CONTEXT that are far from obvious

## A discussion of the theoretical and/or empirical background area of the student’s proposed dissertation, including analysis of relevant prior work

<!-- quick intro, do last -->

The Apple Watch has a heartrate sharing feature. And thumbkisses..... <!-- go on, rant -->

<!-- Now, heartrate has algorithmic meanings; even ones we may not expect [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]. and there are lots of reasons why various parties might be interested in collecting this type of data. companies and consumers. global push toward mhealth and so on. no huge mystires here. But allowing users to *share* their heartrate socially.......,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 -->
	- what is supposed to happen?

	- when are people supposed to use this feature?

idea of mediating interpersonal communciation with physiological sensors goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003], and more recent work [@slovak_understanding_2012]. 

now that these devices are starting to get a bit more REAL............in large part bc of mhealth............ [stats etc].................we need to be asking, is intimacy the whole story?????

<!-- yeah, not at all always positive....its complicated, a highly contextual signal -->

This is the question that led my to my study................................. We know the meaning of these signals are primed heavily by SOCIAL CONTEXT - where the signals were exchanged, and who the participants were to each other [@slovak_understanding_2012]. but its more complicated than that too <!-- also, past work on perceptions of biosignals? valens etc?
and we wonder if heartrate is a 'good example', how other newere modalities might be different
i see valens & neurohype as being quite similar
-->

<!-- but wait! there are more fundamental questions here,..... -->

How does heartrate come to help build intimacy? We might not see the same effect from a stream of, say, your skins weatiness, but why not? By what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning?

Most generally, how do people build these interpretations in the first place?

<!-- i can start talking about the broadest possible scope - charisma of the device/modality; suggestion of the application.... -->

In many cases, the mechanisms by which these interfaces work have less to do with the algorithm than they do with the contextual, social, or narrative interpretations that people draw from sensor data. <!-- a whole array of stuff i could talk about here, ubifit garden; meeting mediator; social signals; EEG; --> suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]

<!-- and i might want to quote dawn nafus at lenght about cultural cohesion etc. -->

now ill need to fade in to a discussion on how affective computing relates to my work

### Affective computing

<!-- rant -->

### Honest signals & bio big data

<!-- rant -->

## Goffman / social signals

<!-- rant - from notes on these topics -->

<!-- donath -->

<!-- bergstrom -->

<!-- meeting mediator -->

## Social exchange theory

<!-- what is it? -->




## A detailed discussion of proposed research methods and how they will address the research question

<!-- 
first graph

	high-level: lab-based behavioral + survey methods

	high-level: why these help us answer certain questions, despite shortcomings
 -->

This dissertation will feature a series of lab-based behavioral experiments and survey-based experiments.

<!-- 
second graph
	
	major topic covered: interpretation of heart-rate in risky interactions

		bc: does it even have an observable social meaning ?
 -->

Blah blah

<!-- 
third graph

	major topic covered: value of heart-rate, vs some other metric, in risky interaction

		bc: do people really care about the metric much ?
 -->

Blah blah

<!-- 
fourth graph

	major topic covered: effect of affectiva..............?????????

		bc: it has a more direct relationship to everday experiences - do ppl trust sensors more than their intuition?
 -->

Blah blah

## A discussion of work already completed towards the student’s proposed dissertation

<!-- CHI 2016 work with coye, first exp we did -->

blah blah sum up exp

<!-- chi 2016 work with coye, second exp we did -->

blah blah sum up exp

<!-- indra/johnwork -->

all this technical stuff so easy now

## A proposed timeline for the student’s proposed dissertation

Timeline for studies:

- Spring 2016: run values study, setup interest miner study

- Fall 2016: run interest miner study

Deadlines for writing:

- May 14, 2016 - chapters 1-3  to committee

- Sep 7, 2016  - chapters 4 & 5 to committee

- Jan 7, 2016  - completed first draft to committee

- May 14, 2017     - file

## Tentative outline

1. Introduction and literature review

Essentially a dissertation-chapter-y version of this prospectus. My analysis of key studies will be a bit more fleshed out, and certainly I will include some new theory and papers I don't yet know of. 

2. Actually measuring

........blurb.........some really fascinating philosophy + technology stuff here


3. Iterated prisoner's dilemma game with heartrate

I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.

4. Vignette experiment with heartrate

This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might "matter" for social behavior. This study serves as a nice springboard FOR.....................

5. Value of biosignals 

........blurb.........

6. Self-reflective interpretations - HR

........blurb.........

7. Self-reflective interpretations - EEG

........blurb.........

8. Conclusion & discussion

Not sure what will come here yet but I look forward to finding out. The major idea here is to speak to that question I mention in the introduction bit -- how do biosignals get assigned social meanings? but,
