# The social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

<!-- remember - end where you begin - begin with apple heartrate sharing, end with it to, but now with a diff lens - generally speaking, take reader on cylcical journeys -->
Biosensing technologies are becoming pervasive in our daily lives, beyond wristwatches and eyeglasses, into clothing, furniture, mirrors, cars, personal robots, ingestibles. 
These technologies will enable us to build increasingly high-resolution models of our bodies in the wild, outside of laboratory settings.
New algorithms will transform our understanding of the body, yielding.........

But, as data from these biosensors become available to designers, we must ask: How will *humans* interpret data from these sensors?


why we want to study this
<!-- contest surveillance -->
<!-- raise some alarms -->

we interrogate this by seeing what these signals express to other people


<!-- Take Apple Watch, which allows users to transmit their heartrate socially, beat by beat, to a friend. When are users supposed to do this? What are they supposed to learn from the data they transmit? -->
<!-- Now, heartrate has algorithmic meanings; even ones we may not expect [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]. and there are lots of reasons why various parties might be interested in collecting this type of data. companies and consumers. global push toward mhealth and so on. no huge mystires here. But allowing users to *share* their heartrate socially.......,,,,,,,,,,,,, -->
<!-- In both cases, the applications imply intimacy. Is this the only thing biosensors are capable of expressing? -->

<!-- While a large body of research explores what algorithms can learn from biosensors, it is not well understood how people derive meaning from the same signals, or how these meanings change in different social contexts. **What is the expressive capacity of biosensors and biosignals?** This question is essential for understanding the privacy and security needs that will come and biosensors become increasingly ubiquitous. -->

<!-- meeting mediator -->

<!-- but wait! there are more fundamental questions here,..... -->
One very relevant question missing from this work is, Why does heartrate help build intimacy? By what mechanism does this effect occur? We might not see the same effect from a stream of, say, your skins weatiness, but why not? 

Most generally, By what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning? How do people build these interpretations in the first place?

In many cases, the mechanisms by which these interfaces work have less to do with the algorithm than they do with the contextual, social, or narrative interpretations that people draw from sensor data. <!-- a whole array of stuff i could talk about here, ubifit garden; meeting mediator; social signals; EEG; --> suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]

<!-- and i might want to quote dawn nafus at lenght about cultural cohesion etc. -->

## A detailed discussion of proposed research methods and how they will address the research question

I will perform controlled, lab-based behavioral experiments, as well as survey experiments, in which subjects partake in risky, uncertain interactions with other people (e.g., the money they receive depends on their behavior). Subjects will be exposed, or not exposed, to a biosignal collected from their partner. By introducing signals such as GSR, heart rate and EEG into classic social- behavioral experimental paradigms (e.g., dictator game, iterated prisoner's dilemma game), or into vignette scenarios, we can begin to observe how the presence of biosignals affects social behavior, as compared to control conditions.

<!-- information about another person under risk and uncertainty 
	abt non-health stuff - mood,thoughts,emotion
-->

Through these studies, I hope to shed some light on how interpretations arise from biosensor data. 
The very big questions here - how these interpretations depend on the sensor, the application context, the phenomenon being sensed - begin to gesture toward the huge mosaic of factors at play in this question. I hope that this very fundamental series of studies opens the dialogue around privacy as they bare on wearable sensors. Data, even raw data that may seem innocuous to end users, can have *contextual* social effects that are far from obvious.

Applications that leverage wearable biosensor data will change the way we relate to our bodies, and to the bodies of others, in ways we do not yet understand.
These studies will provide a limited, but useful starting point for understanding how, why, and when disclosure of biosignals might become relevant. We hope to shed light on how these signals are incorporated into our understandings of the moods, motivations, and goals of other people, which in turn will lay groundwork for a deeper understanding of how wearable data might become sensitive, or might lead to over-disclosure, in different settings and contexts.

- Jan 7, 2016  - completed first draft to committee

- May 14, 2017     - file

## Tentative outline

1. Introduction and literature review

Essentially a dissertation-chapter-y version of this prospectus. My analysis of key studies will be a bit more fleshed out, and certainly I will include some new theory and papers I don't yet know of. <!-- this should be some kind of pub someday -->

2. Actually measuring

........blurb.........some really fascinating philosophy + technology stuff here

3. Iterated prisoner's dilemma game with heartrate

I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.

4. Vignette experiment with heartrate

This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might "matter" for social behavior. This study serves as a nice springboard FOR.....................

5. Value of biosignals 

........blurb.........

6. Self-reflective interpretations - HR

........blurb.........

7. Self-reflective interpretations - EEG

........blurb.........

8. Conclusion & discussion

Not sure what will come here yet but I look forward to finding out. The major idea here is to speak to that question I mention in the introduction bit -- how do biosignals get assigned social meanings? but,
