# The social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans encounter and interpret data from wearable biosensors in different social contexts. <!-- note: write this last -->

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

<!-- 
	some bit about biosensors over everything
	TODO make this not a direct ripoff of biosense proposal
-->

Biosensing technologies are becoming pervasive throughout our daily lives, beyond wristwatches and eyeglasses, into clothing, furniture, mirrors, cars, personal robots, and ingestibles. 
These technologies will allow us to build increasingly high-resolution models of our bodies in the wild, outside of laboratory settings.
Applications that leverage these data could change the way we relate to our bodies, and to the bodies of others, in ways we do not yet understand.

<!--
	data from these biosensors are available to designers
	apple watch, some others
	but what do people make of these data?
	what is their EXPRESSIVE CAPACITY to humans?

	TODO: make sure my THESIS is highlighted in these paragraphs
-->

Among the many changes brought about by the increasing pervasivness of biosensors, one is that the data from these sesnors are made available to application designers. <!-- The Apple Watch.........Thumbkisses....... --> 
However, it is not well understood what people make of these data. When are users supposed to share their heartrates? Whom are we supposed to "thumbkiss"?  In both cases, the applications imply intimacy, but is this the only thing biosensors are capable of expressing?

While a large body of research explores what algorithms can learn from biosensors, it is not well understood how people derive meaning from the same signals, or how these meanings change in different social contexts. What is the expressive capacity of biosensors? This question is essential groundwork for understanding data sensitivities, along with the privacy and security needs of the future.

<!-- 
	in three studies, i will look at
	how people integrate information from biosensors, use it as a sensemaking resource,
		= information about another person
		= information about themselves
	abt non-health stuff - mood,thoughts,emotion

	TODO: talk explicity about info about another person // info about themselves.....
	TODO: do not rip off directly from biosense
-->

I will perform controlled, lab-based experiments, as well as survey-based vignettes, in which subjects partake in risky, uncertain interactions with other people (e.g., the money they receive depends on their behavior). Subjects will be exposed, or not exposed, to a biosignal collected from their partner. By introducing signals such as GSR, heart rate and EEG into classic social- behavioral experimental paradigms (e.g., dictator game, iterated prisoner's dilemma game), or into vignette scenarios, we can begin to observe how the presence of biosignals affects social behavior, as compared to control conditions.

<!--
	through these studies, i hope to shed some light on HOW these interpretations arise. 
	the very big question. how they depend on the sensor, the application, the thing being sensed - begin to gesture toward the huge mosaic of factors at play here.
	i hope that this very fundamental series of studies opens the dialogue around privacy w/r/t wearable sensors - data, even raw data that seems innocuous, can have social effects IN CONTEXT that are far from obvious

	TODO: do not rip off directly from biosense proposal
-->

These studies will provide a limited, but useful starting point for understanding how, why, and when disclosure of biosignals might become relevant. We hope to shed light on how these signals are incorporated into our understandings of the moods, motivations, and goals of other people, which in turn will lay groundwork for a deeper understanding of how wearable data might become sensitive, or might lead to over-disclosure, in different settings and contexts.

## A discussion of the theoretical and/or empirical background area of the student’s proposed dissertation, including analysis of relevant prior work

<!-- quick intro, do last -->

The Apple Watch has a heartrate sharing feature. And thumbkisses..... <!-- go on, rant -->

<!-- Now, heartrate has algorithmic meanings; even ones we may not expect [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]. and there are lots of reasons why various parties might be interested in collecting this type of data. companies and consumers. global push toward mhealth and so on. no huge mystires here. But allowing users to *share* their heartrate socially.......,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 -->
	- what is supposed to happen?

	- when are people supposed to use this feature?

idea of mediating interpersonal communciation with physiological sensors goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003], and more recent work [@slovak_understanding_2012]. 

now that these devices are starting to get a bit more REAL............in large part bc of mhealth............ [stats etc].................we need to be asking, is intimacy the whole story?????

<!-- yeah, not at all always positive....its complicated, a highly contextual signal -->

This is the question that led my to my study................................. We know the meaning of these signals are primed heavily by SOCIAL CONTEXT - where the signals were exchanged, and who the participants were to each other [@slovak_understanding_2012]. but its more complicated than that too <!-- also, past work on perceptions of biosignals? valens etc?
and we wonder if heartrate is a 'good example', how other newere modalities might be different
i see valens & neurohype as being quite similar
-->

<!-- but wait! there are more fundamental questions here,..... -->

<!-- we need to get to this q super fast, or reader will get bored / lost in the weeds  -->
How does heartrate come to help build intimacy? We might not see the same effect from a stream of, say, your skins weatiness, but why not? By what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning?

Most generally, how do people build these interpretations in the first place?

<!-- i can start talking about the broadest possible scope - charisma of the device/modality; suggestion of the application.... -->

In many cases, the mechanisms by which these interfaces work have less to do with the algorithm than they do with the contextual, social, or narrative interpretations that people draw from sensor data. <!-- a whole array of stuff i could talk about here, ubifit garden; meeting mediator; social signals; EEG; --> suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]

<!-- and i might want to quote dawn nafus at lenght about cultural cohesion etc. -->

## Tentative outline

1. Introduction and literature review

Essentially a dissertation-chapter-y version of this prospectus. My analysis of key studies will be a bit more fleshed out, and certainly I will include some new theory and papers I don't yet know of. <!-- this should be some kind of pub someday -->

2. Actually measuring

........blurb.........some really fascinating philosophy + technology stuff here

3. Iterated prisoner's dilemma game with heartrate

I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.

4. Vignette experiment with heartrate

This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might "matter" for social behavior. This study serves as a nice springboard FOR.....................

5. Value of biosignals 

........blurb.........

6. Self-reflective interpretations - HR

........blurb.........

7. Self-reflective interpretations - EEG

........blurb.........

8. Conclusion & discussion

Not sure what will come here yet but I look forward to finding out. The major idea here is to speak to that question I mention in the introduction bit -- how do biosignals get assigned social meanings? but,
