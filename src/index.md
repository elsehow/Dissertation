# the social life of physiological signals

## A brief (preferably a single sentence each) statement of the student’s research question and principal thesis

Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans encounter and interpret data from wearable biosensors in different social contexts. <!-- note: write this last -->

## A longer discussion of the student’s principal thesis, including motivation and justification of importance

<!--

	some bit about biosensors
	ADAPT FROM: CLTC proposal

Blah blah

<!-- 
second graf

	(1) interfaces (generally) can influence their users through cultural narratives embedded in them, through suggestion

	(2) biosensing devices have their own kinds of charisma + lend themselves to certain types of suggestion

 Blah blah 

<!--

	these effects can act as SOCIAL SIGNALS  - have SOCIAL OUTCOMES - 

	MY DISSERTATION: behavioral experiments around how biosensors ==> data ==> social interpretations

	GOAL: reflect somehow on each of these supersets!

Blah blah.

	RELEVANCE: UX designers, and the people who use biosensors

	IMPT BC: slow creep of mhealth across the digital landscape

Blah blah.

<!-- through three studies, I will explore the contextual meanings of various biosignals in different situations. individual projects will attempt to pinpoint ways in whcih biosignal sharing may yield *uncooperative or anti-social behavioral outcomes*, due to the social context in which data were shared.

As sensing devices become more pervasive, as mhealth creeps across the digital landscape, these questions have a big impact both for the people who design interactions with sensors, and for the end-users who buy these devices (buy with money and "buy" with mindhsare, give credence to the data)...........so we need to be careful of these kinds of bad outcomes

in the meantime, i want for my three investigations to congeal toward a larger picture that gestures toward these first questions - how do social interpretations arise from biosensor data? how do these data come to take on socially contextual meanings? this question, which is much larger than my dissertation, has bunches of relevance for anyone who wants to design an mHealth app, or incentivize other people to collect biosensor data....etc. -->


## A discussion of the theoretical and/or empirical background area of the student’s proposed dissertation, including analysis of relevant prior work

<!-- biosignal sharing is reallllllll. but why is it a thing? -->

The Apple Watch	has a heartrate sharing feature.

Now, heartrate has algorithmic meanings; even ones we may not expect [@latvala_longitudinal_2015]. and there are lots of reasons why various parties might be interested in collecting this type of data. companies and consumers. global push toward mhealth and so on. no huge mystires here. But allowing users to *share* their heartrate socially.......,,,,,,,,,,,,,


	- what is supposed to happen?

	- when are people supposed to use this feature?

<!-- because intimacy, duh...... -->

idea of mediating interpersonal communciation with physiological sensors goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003]

<!-- *and what stories were told? *and did they work? what stories were told about that? -->
The story we're told is that this kind of sharing feature will help foster intimacy between participants, a story that goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003]. The more complicated story [@slovak_understanding_2012] is that the meaning of these signals are primed heavily by SOCIAL CONTEXT - where the signals were exchanged, and who the participants were to each other.

<!-- but wait! there are more fundamental questions here,..... -->

But, how does heartrate come to help build intimacy? We might not see the same effect from a stream of, say, your skins weatiness, but why not? By what mechanisms are biosensor data assigned to social meaning?

<!-- i can start talking about the broadest possible scope - charisma of the device/modality; suggestion of the application.... -->

In fact, in many cases, the mechanisms by which these interfaces work have less to do with the algorithm than they do with the contextual, social, or narrative interpretations that people draw from sensor data. <!-- a whole array of stuff i could talk about here, ubifit garden; meeting mediator; social signals; EEG; basically "see below" for that lit story -->

suggestability / moodlight...... [@snyder_moodlight:_2015]..... hype/"enchantment" particular to certain sensing modalities and devices....[@ali_empirical_2014]  (consider eeg applications) AND? "charisma" [@ames_charismatic_2015] of a particular sensing modality......taking it back full circle, heartrate has held particular allure for intimacy apps [@bell_intimate_2003, @janssen_intimate_2010, @slovak_understanding_2012]

<!-- and i might want to quote dawn nafus at lenght about cultural cohesion etc. -->

<!--  NOWW I can introduce social signaling as a mechanism -->

social signalling..... [@goffman_presentation_1959, @bergstrom_social_2009, @bergstrom_conversation_2007, @kim_meeting_2008]

<!-- WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WAIT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
social exchange theory goes here 


also, past work on perceptions of biosignals? valens etc?
and we wonder if heartrate is a 'good example', how other newere modalities might be different
i see valens & neurohype as being quite similar

## A detailed discussion of proposed research methods and how they will address the research question

first graph

	high-level: lab-based behavioral + survey methods

	high-level: why these help us answer certain questions, despite shortcomings

second graph
	
	major topic covered: interpretation of heart-rate in risky interactions

		bc: does it even have an observable social meaning ?

third graph

	major topic covered: value of heart-rate, vs some other metric, in risky interaction

		bc: do people really care about the metric much ?

fourth graph

	major topic covered: effect of affectiva..............?????????

		bc: it has a more direct relationship to everday experiences - do ppl trust sensors more than their intuition?

## A proposed timeline for the student’s proposed dissertation

studies timeline:

- Spring 2016: xlab study

- Fall 2016: affectiva study

writing timeline:

- May 14, 2016 - chapters 1-3  to committee

- Sep 7, 2016  - chapters 4 & 5 to committee

- Jan 7, 2016  - completed first draft to committee

- May 14, 2017     - file

## Tentative outline

1. Introduction and literature review

Essentially a dissertation-chapter-y version of this prospectus. My analysis of key studies will be a bit more fleshed out, and certainly I will include some new theory and papers I don't yet know of. 

2. Iterated prisoner's dilemma game with heartrate

I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.

3. Vignette experiment with heartrate

This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might "matter" for social behavior. This study serves as a nice springboard FOR.....................

4. Value of biosignals / risky interactions

........blurb.........

5. Value of biosignals / friends

........blurb.........

6. Affectiva experiment 1

........blurb.........

7. Affectiva experiment 2

........blurb.........

8. Conclusion & discussion

Not sure what will come here yet but I look forward to finding out. The major idea here is to speak to that question I mention in the introduction bit -- how do biosignals get assigned social meanings? but,
