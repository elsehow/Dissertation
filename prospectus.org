** brief introduction to my topic 
not, "why do we consent to upload sensitive information",
/why + how are biosignals sensitive?/
*** initial
**** DONE summary
This dissertation focuses on how *people* (as opposed to algorithms) interpret data from wearable & environmental biosensors, and how these interpretations affect social behavior.
What can these data say about you? What can they say about someone else?
**** DONE detailed explanation
Based on past work on the human interpretation of sensor data [], and on work already done [], we expect these interpretations to vary depending on context. This dissertation focuses on how four specific factors correlate with people's interpretations of biosignal data:

(1) the way in which interfaces represent a given singal 
(2) social context (relationships to, or beliefs about, the person being sensed)
(3) beliefs about the capabilities of algorithms 
(4) beliefs about the physical phenomenon being sensed
**** DONE closer (?)
One very large question this dissertation aims to answer is, /how is it that biosignals take on any meaning at all/?
Why, and when, do biosignals seem anything but innocuous?
So, each bit of experimental work in my dissertation will, in one way or another,
interrogate people's beliefs about the risk associated with disclosure of biosignals,
examining how these beliefs relate to the above factors.
*** TODO summarize last
** my methods
surveys
lab-based experiments
technology probes (?)
*** DONE specific "good example" studies
**** surveys / survey experiments
consolvo
**** lab-based experiments
pentland - tho many shortcomings
**** tech probes
slovak...
skin conductance
short range
*** TODO why these methods? /what can these methods do?/
<2016-02-15 Mon>
remember, im a psychologist.
play to the strengths of these methods
** TODO a chain of reasoning
<2016-01-27 Wed> <2016-01-28 Thu>
*** work done
**** 1. experimental study with coye
***** taught us biosignals can affect trusting behavior
**** 2. vignette study with coye
***** taught us negative emotional attributes => positive social behaviors
**** synthesizing findings
***** socially contextual signals
in vignette, high heartrate ==> less trust
in experiment, high heartrate==> more trust
***** one piece done...socially contextual signals..
this establishes that ambiguous data like biosensors are as richly contextula as other cues in cmc
while past work has indicated the same is true for signals like GPS [..], past work on biosensor applications have largely missed this; heartrate in particulr has been construed as a singal for "enhancing intimacy", wiht little investigation into its social or contextul meaning [slovak].
***** but more important work yet remains
the riskiness of the signal itself, how much /sensitive/ information it /seems/ to contain
****** the relationship between these attitudes + riskiness 
measured by / willingness to disclose to various parties
and im sure theres past work on that measure...  aquisti... 
****** and relationship between the way an interface represents a signal
******* our exp heartrate study represented signals in a very particular way
we had our reasons
******* we could easily try a different representation, or a different signal,
to try to isolate the independent effect of either

*** what do these findings motivate?
**** DONE relationship between *representation* and riskiness of disclosure
the representation of the data has a tight reltionship
with how risky people think it is to disclose
(if i show you the raw....youll say it means nothing...if i show you some judgemetns...maybe you're less sure...)
,,
**** TODO independent effect of the signal itself
of course heartrate "has some meaning", and we also want to know what that meaning is, independent of the way it is represented by an interface
**** TODO this is a deep / interesting pair of questions for a number of reasons....
***** cultural beliefs about the body...
***** people reason by analogy to their own lived bodily experiences...
**** DONE useful to study because consumer protection
almost a consumer protection thing
companies can represent data in a way that makes them seem less risky to disclose/share
**** DONE also because we can make more delightful+sensitive interfaces
ones that don't assume signals will always be positive
like apple's hr or bell's work.......
*** proposed future studies
**** TODO health-e-heart / disclosure
why people do/do not contrib data...
what they think the data SAY ABOUT THEM
weighed against their OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CONTRIBUTING
,,
we're interested in a group that already seems happy to disclose, and likely have a high intrinsic motivation to do so. so, why are some people disclosing more sensor data than others, even within this highly motivated group? what is the relationship between their disclosure decisions, and what they think the data might say about them? (e.g., how risky this data is to disclose, risk if there were a data leak, etc..)
**** TODO representation / meaning / disclosure
***** TODO spire data / meaning / ris
have ppl collect data (technology probe)
show people breath data
show people breath + interpreted data..
interrogate risk of "unknown signals"
***** TODO heartrate vs GSR
do the same experiment, but swap hr for gsr
or for some made up signal...
does any "eleavted" (versus "normal") signal have the same effect??
***** TODO suggestion from a sensor
does the microintervention make you feel more depressed? (via suggestion that you must be depressed....)

** relevance & past work 
*** DONE introduction
biosensing is on the rise, no doubt
**** could give a provcative example or two
sweden hr study
fitbit senses guys breakup
*** DONE there are a few things we could be worried about:
**** DONE people's mental mental model of how data flows
word on this 
**** DONE why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
word on this
**** DONE why do these data mean anything at all?
well, this seems like the least obvious for sure
compared to the above, why think about this at all?
*** TODO justifying why to study interpretations
*** TODO justifying why to study social interpretations
*** DONE related work
intro about the rise of biosensing, about the rise of apps that let you share biosignals socially (apple watch, thumbkisses, heartgram) - in these apps, people, rather than algorithms, are supposed to interpret biosensory data
however, it's not well understood how people build interpretations around these data, or what mechanisms give rise to these interpretations. in general, the expressive capacity of biosignals is not well understood.
copy from other work hereonout
* notes
** DONE johns notes

> why asking these questions? bc surveillance

context is, im at home
bunch of devices, not even wearables, capable of collecting biosignals in the home (everyone in the home). imagine, these devices not connected to cloud. the "intranet of things" 

how do i share or negotiate shairng with my wife?
intranet of things -sure, i'm happy- once we introduce another person an elderly parent, it gets less ideal.........becomes a question of tradeoffs

if light changes with heartrate, but has to go to fitbit in between, i say forget it

*** three things, two i dont care about 
**** mental model of how data flows
**** why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
**** TODO DO CARE about what these data MEAN
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why and in what way are they not just totally innocuous
"risk"

*** DONE look at economics of privacy
alexandro aquisti
not to go into this area
a couple papers you want to cite
basically pepole have found, they will over-discount risks that are either (a) unknown (b) uncertain (c) far into the future

*** outcomes
shed light on both 
- both how to build apps
- and privacy/consent outcomes


*** how people interpret the data
not just limited to looking at a screen
there is some overlap with elaine's concerns about sharing between devices
some of the questions speak to each other

*** specific methods + studies
general direction is clear
you are pretty clear on this direction
by "direction" i mean "north" (not sure if im going to redding or seattle)
but, i have something more specific? hard to say

worth you trying to figure out something more specific
types of studies
> methods (survey & lab based psych studies)?
i meant studies but methods is just as impt, arguably more
either way, whatever's easier to think about
** TODO will help us in two ways:
*** TODO to produce new kinds of delightful interactions
(?)
*** DONE to better gauge people's sense of risk
this way, we can understand people's models of *risk*
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why are they /not/ just totally innocuous?
we are understanding this to understand's people's sense of "risk"
** TODO find that smbc "gosh grandma youre so old fashioned"
first page of my dissertation

** TODO summarize topic briefly
** TODO what reamins before feedbackable ?
<2016-01-29 Fri>
