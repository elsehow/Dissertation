* prospectus 
** TODO introduction
biosensing is on the rise, no doubt
*** could give a provcative example or two
sweden hr study
fitbit senses guys breakup
*** there are a few things we can be worried about:
**** people's mental mental model of how data flows
word on this 
**** why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
word on this
**** why do these data mean anything at all?
well, this seems like the least obvious for sure
compared to the above, why think about this at all?
** my topic 
we should care about what biosensory data MEAN
to *people*, not to algorithms
what could they say about you, to someone else?
what could they say to someone else, about you?
*** will help us in two ways:
**** to produce new kinds of delightful interactions
(?)
**** to better gauge people's sense of risk
this way, we can understand people's models of *risk*
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why are they /not/ just totally innocuous?
we are understanding this to understand's people's sense of "risk"

** my methods

surveys

lab-based experiments

*** TODO cite specific "good examples"

*** TODO why these methods?

** past work
intro about the rise of biosensing, about the rise of apps that let you share biosignals socially (apple watch, thumbkisses, heartgram) - in these apps, people, rather than algorithms, are supposed to interpret biosensory data

however, it's not well understood how people build interpretations around these data, or what mechanisms give rise to these interpretations. in general, the expressive capacity of biosignals is not well understood.


* feedback
** TODO johns notes

> why asking these questions? bc surveillance

context is, im at home
bunch of devices, not even wearables, capable of collecting biosignals in the home (everyone in the home). imagine, these devices not connected to cloud. the "intranet of things" 

how do i share or negotiate shairng with my wife?
intranet of things -sure, i'm happy- once we introduce another person an elderly parent, it gets less ideal.........becomes a question of tradeoffs

if light changes with heartrate, but has to go to fitbit in between, i say forget it

*** three things, two i dont care about 
**** mental model of how data flows
**** why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
**** TODO DO CARE about what these data MEAN
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why and in what way are they not just totally innocuous
"risk"

*** DONE look at economics of privacy
alexandro aquisti
not to go into this area
a couple papers you want to cite
basically pepole have found, they will over-discount risks that are either (a) unknown (b) uncertain (c) far into the future

*** outcomes
shed light on both 
- both how to build apps
- and privacy/consent outcomes


*** how people interpret the data
not just limited to looking at a screen
there is some overlap with elaine's concerns about sharing between devices
some of the questions speak to each other

*** specific methods + studies
general direction is clear
you are pretty clear on this direction
by "direction" i mean "north" (not sure if im going to redding or seattle)
but, i have something more specific? hard to say

worth you trying to figure out something more specific
types of studies
> methods (survey & lab based psych studies)?
i meant studies but methods is just as impt, arguably more
either way, whatever's easier to think about
