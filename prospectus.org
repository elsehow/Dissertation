** DONE a chain of reasoning
<2016-01-27 Wed> <2016-01-28 Thu>
*** work done
**** 1. experimental study with coye
***** taught us biosignals can affect trusting behavior
**** 2. vignette study with coye
***** taught us negative emotional attributes => positive social behaviors
*** what we're studying
through a variety of survey- and lab-based experiments
the idea of what biosignals can say about a person
esentially asking people to /interpret the meaning of a signal/
and deciding what it says,
deciding how risky it is to disclose, 
how people act in the presence of the signal
social behavior focus
etc....
*** TODO synthesizing findings
<2016-01-29 Fri>
**** one piece done...socially contextual signals..
***** in vignette, high heartrate ==> less trust
***** in experiment, high heartrate==> more trust
***** different things different contexts
**** so, biosignals are richly contexutal, like all other signals in CMC
***** seems ovious, but biosignals have been looked over in contextual interpretation / sensors lit
while past work has indicated the same is true for signals like GPS [..], past work on biosensor applications have largely missed this; 
***** heartrate UX in particular seems stuck on "intimacy"
heartrate in particulr has been construed as a singal for "enhancing intimacy", wiht little investigation into its social or contextul meaning [slovak].
**** BUT,,,different...COMPLEX interactions with /cultural beliefs about the body/...
***** so much interesting work on this with hr
****** famous Valens study
****** describe one some
***** sure to contrast with "reality", that chronic heartrate might be more informative...[sweden]
***** "but, these intuitions do not match emprical realities. they are not based on them, and often do not reference them."
****** "complex web" argument
beliefs about the meaning of biosignals are constructed from a /complex web/ of both /social and cultural beliefs/, as well as /lived bodily experiences/ 
****** we need to study these beliefs
reference outcomes we want
****** no way to really untangle the web
******* i don't try to, 
******* only show that representations /are/ there, separate from meaning, & /are/ complex
***** to start - independent effect of the signal (vs. representation)
****** try to show the independent effect of the signal itself, when controlling for different forms of represntation by interfaces
****** then, we see some effect is left over, it itself is contextual, and we can be convinced that...
there are complex meanings to sensors etc
****** NOW we can finally....
learn more about disclosure
both how an interface affects "risk"and how the signal itself may be intrinscly risky
see outcomes, below....
**** propose to be measuring what
***** independent effect of the signal, versus effect of the way an interface represnts it
****** independent effect of the signal
******* cultural beliefs about the body...
******* people reason by analogy to their own lived bodily experiences...
****** effect of the way an interface represnts it
******* our exp heartrate study represented signals in a very particular way
we had our reasons
******* we could easily try a different representation, or a different signal,
to try to isolate the independent effect of either
****** neither is "More interesting" than the other
******* we just want to know WHY and HOW biosignals come to mean anything at all
******* any kind of understanding will help us understand how, why, and when people consent to biosurveillance
******* reference outcomes again
***** attitudes about disclosure
the riskiness of the signal itself, how much /sensitive/ information it /seems/ to contain
****** measuring riskiness of disclosure
******* sensitivity of data measured by / willingness to disclose to various parties
******* and im sure theres past work on that measure...  aquisti... 
**** why measuring
***** useful to study because consumer protection
companies can represent data in a way that makes them seem less risky to disclose/share
****** also because we can make more delightful+sensitive interfaces (?)
ones that don't assume signals will always be positive
like apple's hr or bell's work.......
*** TODO but wait.....................
but, also want to know how ppl /actually act in vivo/
and how UNCONSCIOUS influence can exert itself in sensing contexts....
im thinking of the depression micro-intervention thing

representation, or presence of UI, has an effect..........


*** DONE effects of *representation* versus *signal itself*, in the meaning of biosignals 
**** the representation of the data has a tight reltionship with how risky people think it is to disclose
if i show you the raw....youll say it means nothing...if i show you some judgemetns...maybe you're less sure...
,,
**** meaning as defend by sesnitivity
the social meaning of biosignals - 
**** TODO independent effect of the signal itself
of course heartrate "has some meaning", and we also want to know what that meaning is, independent of the way it is represented by an interface
**** TODO this is a deep / interesting pair of questions for a number of reasons....
*** proposed future studies
**** TODO health-e-heart / disclosure
why people do/do not contrib data...
what they think the data SAY ABOUT THEM
weighed against their OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CONTRIBUTING
,,
we're interested in a group that already seems happy to disclose, and likely have a high intrinsic motivation to do so. so, why are some people disclosing more sensor data than others, even within this highly motivated group? what is the relationship between their disclosure decisions, and what they think the data might say about them? (e.g., how risky this data is to disclose, risk if there were a data leak, etc..)
**** TODO representation / meaning / disclosure
***** TODO spire data / meaning / ris
have ppl collect data (technology probe)
show people breath data
show people breath + interpreted data..
interrogate risk of "unknown signals"
***** TODO modify HR exp w GSR, or made up signal
does any "eleavted" (versus "normal") signal have the same effect??
***** TODO suggestion from a sensor
does the microintervention make you feel more depressed? (via suggestion that you must be depressed....)
** relevance & past work 
*** introduction
biosensing is on the rise, no doubt
*** biosurveillance
**** biosurveillance is our life
biosurveillance, a term formerly used strictly for montioring disease,
can now reasonably be extended to our daily, lived experiences.
**** could give a provcative example or two
sweden hr study
fitbit senses guys breakup
**** validates abowd's "fourth generation"
in some sense, it validates Abowd's "fourth generation" of personal computing:
in the third, ubicomp dissolved machines into our everyday life;
in the fourth, chronic biosurveillance blurs the lines between where computational devices end, and where we begin
*** there are a few things we could be worried about:
**** DONE people's mental mental model of how data flows
word on this 
**** DONE why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
word on this
**** DONE why do these data mean anything at all?
well, this seems like the least obvious for sure
compared to the above, why think about this at all?
*** TODO justifying why to study interpretations
only doctors examined biosignals in the past. but, now there is a reason to study normal people...
*** TODO justifying why to study social interpretations
*** DONE related work
intro about the rise of biosensing, about the rise of apps that let you share biosignals socially (apple watch, thumbkisses, heartgram) - in these apps, people, rather than algorithms, are supposed to interpret biosensory data
however, it's not well understood how people build interpretations around these data, or what mechanisms give rise to these interpretations. in general, the expressive capacity of biosignals is not well understood.

** my methods
surveys
lab-based experiments
technology probes (?)
*** DONE specific "good example" studies
**** surveys / survey experiments
consolvo
**** lab-based experiments
pentland - tho many shortcomings
**** tech probes
slovak...
skin conductance
short range
*** TODO why these methods? /what can these methods do?/
<2016-02-15 Mon>
remember, im a psychologist.
should be obvious why these methods are good - ive set the questions up right
in any case, play to the strengths of these methods
* notes
** DONE johns notes

> why asking these questions? bc surveillance

context is, im at home
bunch of devices, not even wearables, capable of collecting biosignals in the home (everyone in the home). imagine, these devices not connected to cloud. the "intranet of things" 

how do i share or negotiate shairng with my wife?
intranet of things -sure, i'm happy- once we introduce another person an elderly parent, it gets less ideal.........becomes a question of tradeoffs

if light changes with heartrate, but has to go to fitbit in between, i say forget it

*** three things, two i dont care about 
**** mental model of how data flows
**** why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
**** TODO DO CARE about what these data MEAN
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why and in what way are they not just totally innocuous
"risk"

*** DONE look at economics of privacy
alexandro aquisti
not to go into this area
a couple papers you want to cite
basically pepole have found, they will over-discount risks that are either (a) unknown (b) uncertain (c) far into the future

*** outcomes
shed light on both 
- both how to build apps
- and privacy/consent outcomes


*** how people interpret the data
not just limited to looking at a screen
there is some overlap with elaine's concerns about sharing between devices
some of the questions speak to each other

*** specific methods + studies
general direction is clear
you are pretty clear on this direction
by "direction" i mean "north" (not sure if im going to redding or seattle)
but, i have something more specific? hard to say

worth you trying to figure out something more specific
types of studies
> methods (survey & lab based psych studies)?
i meant studies but methods is just as impt, arguably more
either way, whatever's easier to think about
** DONE will help us in two ways:
*** TODO to produce new kinds of delightful interactions
(?)
*** DONE to better gauge people's sense of risk
this way, we can understand people's models of *risk*
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why are they /not/ just totally innocuous?
we are understanding this to understand's people's sense of "risk"
** DONE brief introduction to my topic synthesized from webpage.....
not, "why do we consent to upload sensitive information",
/why + how are biosignals sensitive?/
*** initial
**** DONE summary
This dissertation focuses on how *people* (as opposed to algorithms) interpret data from wearable & environmental biosensors, and how these interpretations affect social behavior.
What can these data say about you? What can they say about someone else?
**** DONE detailed explanation
Based on past work on the human interpretation of sensor data [], and on work already done [], we expect these interpretations to vary depending on context. This dissertation focuses on how four specific factors correlate with people's interpretations of biosignal data:

(1) the way in which interfaces represent a given singal 
(2) social context (relationships to, or beliefs about, the person being sensed)
(3) beliefs about the capabilities of algorithms 
(4) beliefs about the physical phenomenon being sensed
**** DONE closer (?)
One very large question this dissertation aims to answer is, /how is it that biosignals take on any meaning at all/?
Why, and when, do biosignals seem anything but innocuous?
So, each bit of experimental work in my dissertation will, in one way or another,
interrogate people's beliefs about the risk associated with disclosure of biosignals,
examining how these beliefs relate to the above factors.
