Biosensors are everywhere these days. But what can their data reveal about
us---about the inner parts of our minds, our moods, our emotions, identities?
This dissertation explores /people's beliefs/ about this question; how
these beliefs affect and arise from their interactions with digital sensors, and
from their beliefs about the mind and body.

This dissertation focuses on two main cases. First, I discuss a laboratory
experiment examining how people build emotional meanings around basic
biosignals, both familiar and unfamiliar. Second, I discuss a deployment of a
working brain-computer interface among software engineers, surfacing how these
engineers make sense of the brain and mind, and machines' ability to ``read''
them.

The purpose of this dissertation is twofold. First, it surfaces an unstable
boundary between sensing bodies and sensing minds. Second, it proposes the
porousness of this boundary as a site for studying the impact that biosensing
devices will play in near future. As biosensors creep into smart watches, bands,
and ingestibles, they will build increasingly high resolution models of bodies
in space. Their ability to divine not just what these bodies do, but what they
think and feel, presents an under-explored avenue for understanding and
imagining the role these technologies will play in everyday life.

Chapter [[limits]] begins by introducing the notion that the mind is readable from
consumer devices worn on the body and embedded in the environment. It reframes
some past studies in computer science and adjacent fields as having already
begun the work of theorizing and building computational /models of minds/
(Section [[modelsofminds]]). It then motivates human beliefs as a starting point for
discovering the relevance of the readable, both in how engineers will model it,
and how end-users will encounter these models in life.

Since the human belief plays such a central role in making models of minds
relevant, Chapter [[group16]] continues with an examination of how end-users
conceive of the mind with respect to heartrate, a popular biosensor in
commercial sensing devices. Through a vignette study, this chapter shows how
people enroll biosensory data heartrate in social, computer-mediated
contexts to build interpretations.

While this study establishes that people can build socially-relevant meanings
around basic biosignals, we do not know how these beliefs about mind affect
people's behaviors, nor how specific our findings are to heartrate. In Chapter
[[cscw17]], we apply quantitative and qualitative analyses to an iterated prisoner's
dilemma game, in which heartrate information (“elevated” or “normal”) was shared
between players. In a follow-up study, we replicate our initial study, but
replace heartrate with an unfamiliar biosignal, “Skin Reflectivity Index (SRI).”
We find that both heartrate and the unfamiliar biosignal are associated with
negative mood attributions, but we observe a decrease in cooperative behavior
only with elevated heartrate. Our findings highlight the role prior beliefs can
play in shaping interpretations of a biosignal, while suggesting that designers
can, perhaps inadvertently, train users to associate signals with social
meanings.

Having established that people build mind-related meanings around basic
biosignals, Chapter [[toward-brains]] examines how people make sense of data from a
variety of other biosensors. I report on the qualitative and quantitative
results of survey among participants in a large (n>10,000), longitudinal health
study, and an Amazon Mechanical Turk population. Through these data, I locate
brainscanning, and EEG specifically, as a fruitful case for understanding how
particular sensing technologies construct notions of mind.

Having motivated EEG as a fruitful sensing modality for further exploration,
Chapter [[chi]] shifts in focus from users to software engineers, studying their
interactions with a working brain-based authentication system. This population's
beliefs are particularly critical as consumer brainscanning devices have become
open to tinkering through software. Although we find a diverse set of beliefs
among our participants, we discover a shared understanding of the mind as a
physical entity that can and will be ``read'' by machines.

# Chapter [[cscw]] dives deeper into data from the prior chapter, revealing our
# participants’ beliefs about the nature of the self as it relates to the brain. I
# find that the software engineers in our study hold complex notions of self
# involving multiple material contingencies over time, which existing
# authentication systems do not capture. I discuss the relationship between
# participants' beliefs of self and the mind, using this dissonance to understand
# how beliefs may structure and inform technical practice. We find that the
# software

To conclude, chapter [[conclusion]] proposes the term /telepathy/ to describe the
encoding and transmission of minds. I attempt to chart a path for future work,
highlighting tensions between opportunities for novel computer-mediated
communication and concerns around security, privacy and surveillance. I also
gesture toward larger questions of mindhood; I propose telepathy as a way to
understand not just what computers can know about us, but how machines can shape
our notions of who and what we are as thinking things.

* Ants, Fungus & Telepathy

# Spicy mood intro
#

Would you wear a device in the workplace if your manager thought it could track your
productivity, or creativity cite:Burleson2012? Would you allow your child to wear the same
device in schools, where it could monitor both their academic achievement and
their mental health cite:Canzian2015? Would you wear a fitness tracker if your
resting heartrate could predict your future involvement in violent crime cite:Latvala2015?

In all of these examples, sensing technologies blur the line between /sensing
bodies/ and /sensing minds/. Today, increasingly inexpensive sensors with
developer-friendly SDKs and APIs allow those with requisite software expertise
to (purport to) detect phenomena ranging from mental health to mood, all without
direct data about the brain cite:Feel.co2018.
# Given the general encroachment of biosensing in everyday life, this paper asks:
# If these devices can build models of our bodies, can they too build /models of
# our minds/?

#
# Description of paper & forward references
#

In this chapter, I seek to dethrone the assumption that brain-scanning is
necessary for computers to ``read'' or ``decode'' the mind. Drawing from
contemporary theories of embodied, extended and distributed cognition, I argue
that consumer sensing devices are already able to grasp at the contents of our
minds by sensing our bodies, tools, and built environment (Section [[beyondbrain]]).
I relate this argument to existing work in affective computing and computational
social science, reframing them as having already begun the work of theorizing
and building computational /models of minds/ (Section [[modelsofminds]]).

Drawing on critiques of this work, I center the primacy of human interpretation
in both constructing models of minds, and interpreting their relevance in daily
life, and propose this interprative process as a starting point for
understanding how models of minds might operate in the world (Section
[[interpretation]]). I conclude by considering the limits of what computers can know
about the human mind, and how beliefs about the mind structure these limits
(Section [[limits]]). 

** Background
<<beyondbrain>>

Consider the ant. The fungal complex /Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato/
overtakes the ant's behavior without acting on its brain at all. Instead,
it uses the ant's body to navigate the world, constructing a network of coordinated
sensing and actuation atop the ant's muscles cite:Fredericksen2017. By sensing the ant's environment
and stimulating its muscles in response, it causes the ant to crawl beneath a twig and bite into it;
once affixed to the twig, the fungus paralyzes the ant, using its body as a breeding ground (Figure [[antfig]]).

#+CAPTION: /Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato/ takes control of an ant's mind without input from its brain. By constructing a network of sensors and actuators atop its muscles, the fungal complex forces the ant to chew on the underside of a twig, after which the ant's body will serve only as a medium for fungal reproduction.
#+NAME: antfig
[[./figures/just-ant.jpg]]


Ignoring questions of control, consider the degree of /sensing/ the fungus must
perform in order to utilize the ant's body. Using the ant's
bodily infrastructure, the fungus creates a /model/ of ant-experience robust enough to
control the organism completely. Although the /Ophiocordyceps/ fungal
complex cannot read the ant's brain (it has no physical presence there), it can
read the ant's /mind/ well enough to model its environment and body. The
fungus' model of ant-experience may not be the same, or even similar, to those
used by the host ant. Regardless, they are of a sufficient resolution to allow
the fungus to achieve its (reproductive) goals.

With this fungus in mind, consider the emerging class of internet of things
(IoT) devices, which are increasingly embedded in the built environment, worn on
the body, worn inside the body via ingestible pills (Figure \ref{fig:wearable}).
Though common, cameras too sense bodies, often in public and without subjects'
knowledge cite:DBLP:journals/corr/SedenbergWC17. All of these 
connected devices are endowed to some degree with the capacity to sense (and to
build models of) human bodies in space. Past work has referred to this process broadly
as /biosensing/, and these devices as /biosensors/ cite:day2016biosensing.

While humans are significantly more complex than ants, the /Ophiocordyceps/
fungal complex helps illustrate the possibility of creating /models of minds/
with limited or no information from the brain. If fungus can do so, perhaps
consumer sensing devices can, as well. As I review in this section, contemporary
philosophical theories engage seriously with the notion of a beyond-the-brain
mind. As I discuss in Section [[modelsofminds]], these theories allow the physical
phenomena detected by commercial sensors to be constitutent of the mind.

What is the mind? What is its relationship to the body, and to the physical
world? Philosophers have proposed two basic categories for answers to this
question. /Dualism/ posits that the mind has non-physical components, whereas
/physicalism/ posits a mind of only physical components (for a slice of this
debate, see cite:Chalmers1998). The physicalist interpretation lends itself
naturally to scientific study. From the physicalist perspective, all phenomena
in the mind can be reduced to descriptions of physical activity; thus, some
physical theory will eventually explain the mind in entirety.

The physicalist stance of mind also squares with materialist ontologies
generally, for example Jane Bennett's account of /thing-materialism/, in which
things in the world have an intrinsic power, locked in networks of interactions
with other things cite:Bennett2013a. In turn, materialist ontologies square the
physicalist account of mind with the project of biosensing. If mental phenomena
are physical, then mental phenomena are potentially the subject of sensing.

The remainder of this section outlines various physicalist theories of the mind.
Beginning in cognitive science, I trace critiques of this field through to the
alternative theories that have come to meet them. These alternative theories
motivate notions of beyond-the-brain mind, which in turn motivate the discussion
on biosensors that follows in Section [[modelsofminds]].

*** Cognitive science

Cognitive science has historically been an influential source of physicalist
theories about the mind. The field takes a computational account of the brain,
understanding how it ``processes information'' cite:Winograd1987a within the
physical constraints of computational space and time cite:shepard1971mental. Its
questions operate a level of abstraction above the biological concerns of
neuroscience, but below the behavioral concerns of psychology. 

This perspective offers computational /models/ of ``cognition''
cite:shepard1971mental. As physical models can inform structural engineering,
cognitive scientific models have inspired research across psychology, artificial
intelligence, and design cite:Agre1997. For example, these models informed the
design of neural networks, before the relatively recent discovery of performant
backpropogation algorithms made neural networks practical to deploy
cite:minsky1969perceptrons.

However, cognitive science has received considerable criticism
cite:Noe2004,Winograd1987a. Two relevant critiques focus on
cognitive science's ``isolationist assumptions'': a focus on the brain (isolated
from the body), and a focus on the individual (isolated from social context, and
from the environment). The following sections review major responses to
these critiques: embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and extended
cognition. These theories return later as I discuss prior work in affective
computing and computational social science.

*** Embodied cognition

Cognitive science's isolation of the brain rests on the belief that the brain is
strictly equivalent to the mind. This assumption has encountered two primary
critiques. First, the dichotomy between the brain and body is
unstable; neurons occur body-wide, running directly to the brain, such that it
is difficult to evaluate the role of cerebral neural activity in the functions
of mind irrespective of non-cerebral neural activity. Second, to quote Noë and
Thompson (2004), ``The exact way organisms are embodied simultaneously
constrains and prescribes certain interactions within the environment.''
cite:Noe2004. In other words, mind is manifested as it is due to the physical
conditions of the body.

These critiques gave rise to the /Embodiment thesis/: that an agent's
beyond-the-brain body plays a causal role in that agent's cognitive processing.
For example, Noë and O'Regan's analysis of vision recasts the ``visual
processing'' of cognitive science, in which internal representations are built
and manipulated within the brain, to an active, embodied process, in which the
world is not simply waiting to be seen, but actively providing its own
representations; the body and brain must meet through an active process of
co-adaptation cite:ORegan2001a. In its account of vision as an active process of
co-construction, this analysis shares with some work in feminist epistemology,
e.g. cite:Haraway1988b.

*** Extended and distributed cognition


While the embodiment thesis prods at the causal relationship between mind and
the physical conditions of the body, it glosses over the relationship between
these bodies and the world in which they are situated. In response, Clark and
Chalmer's /extended cognition/ thesis argues that the environment at large can be
considered as part of the mind; that
``technological resources such as pens, paper, and personal computers are now so
deeply integrated into our everyday lives that we couldn’t accomplish many of
our cognitive goals and purposes without them'' cite:Clark1998.

This theory does not stop at tools in describing a mind beyond the
body. Broadly, extended cognition refocuses the brain away from the individual
body, and toward the ``active role of the environment in shaping cognition''
cite:Clark1998. This theory paved the way toward a socially-extended cognition,
or ``distributed cognition,'' as described in Hutchins' (1995) ethnography of
sailors on a naval vessel cite:hutchins1995cognition. In his analysis, multiple
individuals, and the material environment play constituent roles in cognition,
manifesting a mind that is distributed across multiple human and non-human
actors.

# Though I do not cover activity theory in depth here, suffice to say the theory
# covers many of the same topics, though its intellectual history was quite remote
# from the other theories mentioned (having "grown up" in the USSR). for a review,
# see _review_.

In addressing some critiques levied against cognitive science,
the theories in this section make various cases for a mind that
extends beyond the confines of the brain, and even beyond the confines of the
body. The following section argues these theories (unwittingly) make the mind
amenable to modeling via sensors that are worn or embedded in the environment,
and that past research has (also unwittingly) already begun to sense the mind
from beyond the brain.

** Models of minds
<<modelsofminds>>

# Embodied cognition focuses on the
# body's role in cognition, where extended and distributed cognition theorize
# cognition as a process distributed across human and non-human actors. 
The theories outlined in the previous section all propose that the mind is
physically instantiated in the material world. They differ only in /where/ this
mind is said to exist, and where it does its work. Using these theories, this
section argues that prior work in ubiquitous computing has already attempted to
sense aspects of mind from beyond-the-brain bodies.

To assist in this analysis, I propose term /models of minds/. This term borrows
from autism research's /theory of mind/, which refers to the (human) ability to
reason about mental states cite:Baron-Cohen1995. By substituting the word
``theory'' with the word ``model,'' I emphasize formal or algorithmic
representations. By then turning this singular ``model of mind'' into a plural
/models of minds/, I highlight the intrinsic contestability of the algorithms
that build them, the beliefs that underlie their construction, and the diversity
of minds in the world to model. The term aims to cast a subtle doubt on models
that appear too simple, or which (cl)aim to generalize too broadly.

In the remainder of this section, I read two strands of existing work through
different accounts of mind: affective computing through embodied cognition, and
computational social science through distributed and embodied cognition. I argue
that these theories make these two fields able to claim that they sense the
ground truth of mental phenomena. Thus, I argue that these fields have already
begun the work of building models of minds using data from the
beyond-the-brain-body.
# TODO By reviewing critiques of these two fields,
# I motivate a discussion of human (rather than machine) interpretation in the
# following section.

*** Affective computing

Affective computing, pioneered by Rosalind Picard at the MIT Media Lab, seeks to
use sensors to measure a users' affect, modeling their emotions in order to
improve their interaction with machines. cite:Picard1997a. In this program,
affective computing is concerned with mind reading in the sense that people
perform it: the construction of a ``theory of mind'' cite:Baron-Cohen1995.

Relevant to our discussion, affective computing frames affect as bodily states,
relating the field to embodied cognition; however, affective computing extends
these claims further, positing that wearable sensors can measure, encode, and
transmit emotions through their sensing of bodily states cite:Healey2014.
Although work in affective computing does not generally make explicit references
to embodied cognition, it typically seeks to detect emotion via bodily
phenomena, and does not consider these phenomena to be proxies from real
emotions, indicating a general view of emotions as embodied primarily
cite:Healey2014. Two commercial examples of such sensing come directly from work
in Rosalind Picard's research group. The Empatica wristband senses electrodermal
activity, with the aim of correlating these data to emotional states
cite:Garbarino2015. This wristband has gone on to inspire cheaper consumer
alternatives, such as the Feel cite:Feel.co2018. Also from Picard's lab,
Affectiva classifies emotions from facial expressions, as detected through a
camera. Their infrastructure works through a webcam, providing what they term
``Emotion as a Service'' cite:AffectivaInc.2016.

In both of these examples, the body that is being sensed. Are these bodily
phenomena correlates of emotions, or constiutent of them? Though affective
computing work does not cite the embodied cognition explicitly, this theory
allows the claim that affective computing devices are sensing emotions directly.
That is, embodied cognition allows the claim that sensors to capture ground
truth of emotions rather than correlates. In the next section, we will see how
distributed and extended cognition allow claims that past work has sensed the
mind from beyond the body.

*** Computational social science

In this section, I argue that distributed and extended cognition allow past work
in computational social science to claim that these sensors can detect the
ground truth of mental phenomena. Past work in computational social science has
used mobile sensors as source of data about human interaction, efforts that
predate both commercial IoT devices and the general ubiquity of smartphones in
the global north. One early example is Sandy Pentland's sociometer, an
internet-connected necklace outfitted with a variety of sensors
cite:OlguinOlguin2009. In contrast to Picard's affective measurements from
single users, Pentland's work measures phenomena distributed across multiple
individuals.

The Social fMRI provides a seminal example. A distributed, multimodal sensing
infrastructure, implemented via mobile phones over more than a year, aimed at
sensing ``how things spread in [a] community, such as ideas, decisions, mood, or
the seasonal flu'' cite:Aharony2011. In this frame, both ``ideas'' and ``the
flu'' are equated as properties not of individuals, but of communities and relationships.
The Social fMRI study spawned numerous, similar projects, including one
explicitly aimed at detecting ``happiness'' cite:Bogomolov2013 or ``creativity''
cite:Burleson2012, and, relevant to our discussion, one that aimed to diagnose
depression from mobile phone traces cite:Canzian2015. In this study,
longitudinal GPS traces were correlated with answers on questionnaires via
machine learning and related statistical techniques.

# Distributed cognition explicitly provides a framework within which these
# multi-individual measures are not correlated with phenomena of the mind (e.g.,
# ideas, decisions), but rather pertain to their ground truth. 
As embodied cognition allows affective computing to present bodily phenomena as
constituent of emotions, distributed and extended cognition allow this work to
present extrabodily and multi-individual phenomena as constituent of mental
states. If one believes depression to be an embodied phenomenon then the phone
could be said to sense depression's bodily correlates. However, if one believes
depression to be an extended phenomenon, then the cellphone could in fact be /a
constituent of the depression itself/, to report the ground truth of depression.
Distributed and extended cognition are instructive in understanding how
technical artifacts might seek the ground truth of phenomena relating to the
mind, such that models can be said to be (in)accurate.

In the next section, I review critiques of the work discussed above. I use these
critiques to center the role of human interpretation in building models of minds
and in making them legible in the course of life, setting up a discussion in
Section [[limits]] about how the limits within which models of mind might be created
and understood.

# TODO Mind reading and telepathy occur here through the interaction of
# human beliefs and material configurations.

# I discuss the centrality of human intepretation in the following section.
# _Explain how computational social science is *actually* telepathy --- implicitly uses distributed cognition to understand mental phenomena like stress, anxiety, depression etc_.
# _Aided by infrastructures of machine learning that require large, multi-subject corpora, finding relational and longitudinal dependencies in the dataset_.
# perhaps affective computing hits this spec as well ^

** Centrality of interpretation
<<interpretation>>

Today, the world of computational social science has informed the commercial
world of targeted advertisements; affective computing has begun to creep into
our lived experience, with consumer devices that purport to continuously measure
emotions cite:Feel.co2018. The research programs in ubiquitous computing (or
/ubicomp/) discussed in the prior section have shifted from proximate future
cite:Bell2007 to our lived present.

However, their legacy lives on. Computational social science, for example,
relied heavily on top-down maps (the Social fMRI event included a figure with an
eye looking downward). This top-down purview of the scientist eschewed
potential concerns around individual privacy, a legacy that continues to produce
struggles in IoT. Consider the contemporary example of Uber's employees-only
``god view,'' which makes visible the location and movements of all users and
drivers cite:Nunberg2014. The persistence of top-down perspective in modern work
gestures broadly to the ways beliefs and assumptions can be fed forward from
academic studies into commercial products, becoming ensconced in technical
artifacts.

Given the ongoing relevance of these research programs in our emerging world of
pervasive biosensing, this section reviews some of the most pointed critiques
these fields have encountered. These critiques center the role of human
interpretation in making models of minds buildable (by engineers) and legible
(to end-users) in the course of life. In supporting this perspective, I review
past work on how people bring signals from the body to bear on the mind.

# This section sets up a discussion in Section [[limits]] about how the limits
# within which models of mind might be created and understood.

*** The epistemology of Ubicomp

Ubicomp has received a variety of critiques, particularly in its attempts to
classify or detect mental phenomena. First, these studies have tended to frame
mental states as definite entities for which a single ground truth exists.
Boehner et al cite:Boehner2007b propose an alternative: emotions as
co-constructed, performed socially, and understood only in collaboration with
other socially-experiencing subjects. An account of socially situated emotions
has received some limited uptake within affective computing cite:Parkinson2015.
However, these theories still pre-categorize emotions, obscuring phenomena at
the borders of these categories cite:Boehner2007b. This critique effectively
posits that beliefs about the mind limit what phenomena can be modeled or
sensed.

Second, neither field has substantively engaged with the question of how
algorithms and devices that seek to detect emotion may affect the way emotion is
experienced or performed. Past work strongly indicates that feedback about
emotional experience may alter the way emotions are experienced
cite:Snyder2015a, and that context may radically alter the way these models are
understood cite:Merrill2017. In this critique, beliefs about the mind strongly
inform, and therefore limit, what can be /understood/ about the mind from a
given model.

*** Bringing signals from the body to bear on the mind

If beliefs about the mind structure interpretations of biosensory data, then how
do these interpretations come to be about the mind? I argue that the meaning of
biosignals are shaped by prior beliefs about the body, as well the suggestion
provided by particular social contexts
cite:Merrill2017,Ali2014a,Snyder2015a. Through past work, I outline how the
suggestion provided by particular sensing devices can meet with pre-existing
beliefs about the body, producing socially-relevant interpretations regarding
the mind.


In Ali et al (2014), undergraduates in neuroscience believed a ``scanner'' (in
reality, a perm machine from a hair salon, painted gray) could read their
thoughts in some detail, even after the researchers told them explicitly that
such technology is not (yet) possible cite:Ali2014a. The authors suggest that
this indicates people have some intrinsic faith in brainscanning, perhaps due to
``neurohype'' in popular media. Another way of interpreting this finding,
however, is that /biosensing systems/ offer a particular sort of suggestion, or
sort of white lab-coat effect of their own, which interacts with social context
to produce specific interpretations. This latter proposal is suggested by
cite:Snyder2015a, in which the /Moodlight/ is able to make people feel relaxed,
simply by suggesting that the person is relaxed already. From the user's
perspective, either that the machine ``knows better'' than they do, or that
people fill in the gaps in their ability to introspect using the machine's
suggestions. This interpretation is also suggested by cite:Bergstrom2011, in
which the amount of time people were talking in a group conversation was
displayed visually on a table. This study finds that people are willing to
believe some distortion, but only to a point. Interfaces provide suggestions,
which end users may accept even when they conflict with what users feel to be
true.


However, suggestibility does not entirely account for why people build
interpretations about the mind from sensor data. People bring beliefs to the
table as well, which structure what they are willing to accept. For example, the
results observed in cite:Ali2014a had something to do with the fact that the
machine was scanning the brain; if it had been taking a saliva sample, for
example, subjects may not have been as likely to believe it could detect their
thoughts. In other words, beliefs about what biosensing devices can capture
about the mind are a product both of the suggestion provided by particular
interfaces, and their pre-existing beliefs about the body, and the relationship
between the body and phenomena in the mind. These beliefs may vary with culture,
as well. We have no particular reason to think they are any more universal than,
e.g. the perception of color cite:Regier2009.

The central role that beliefs about the body play are re-enforced by studies on
ubiquitous heartrate sharing. Heartrate sensors have been among the first
physiological sensors to be widely embedded in consumer devices, usually in
smartwatches or earbuds. Slovák (2012)'s foundational study on heartrate sharing
cite:Slovak2012 revealed that beliefs about heartrate can take on meanings that
relate intrinsically to the presumed meaning of hearts and heartrate. In
cite:Merrill2017, we found that an elevated heartrate signal correlated with
reduced cooperation in an iterated trust game, where elevated ``SRI'' (a
fictitious biosignal) did not. These studies indicate that beliefs about the
body, originating either from media, or embodied experience, have some effect in
suggesting possible meanings for biosignals in social context.

*** How minds are made and modeled

The case of affective computing in relation to embodied cognition, or of
computational social science in relation to distributed and extended cognition,
illustrate how beliefs about the mind inform, shape and structure the claims
that technical practitioners make about the artifacts they design. Although
these projects did not explicitly cite philosophical progenitors, their shared
perspectives on the mind afforded their success in detecting phenomena such as
emotion or mental health.

Given the lasting impact of not just these research programs, but the
perspectives they embed, it is critical to review the perspectives of these
programs and their antecedents. The perspectives of engineers are relevant to
understanding what they build, and why. Some past work has looked at engineers
beliefs with respect to sensing devices. For example, Sample's work on
neuroengineers cite:Sample2016 and Merrill et al's work on software engineers
cite:Merrill2018 have examined engineers' complex and heterogeneous beliefs
about the mind and body.

Opposite the beliefs of engineers, users' beliefs about the mind, formal or
informal, also inform, shape and structure what users believe, or are willing to
believe. To quote Dawn Nafus as she described her early studies in biosensing,
``figuring out whether a consumer market for biosensors was even thinkable had
everything to do with whether the data they produced cohered with a cultural and
social imaginary, such that users stood a chance of making sense of them''
cite:nafus2016quantified.


** Conclusion

In this chapter, I reviewed how beliefs in such theories (formal or informal)
play a critical role in defining how models of minds are built, and how they are
understood as relevant in the course of life. While we will return to the
question of how models of minds are built in Chapter [[chi]], the following chapter
will look at how end-users interpret models of minds in social context. The two
studies described there will demonstrate how people use basic biosignals in
computer-mediated contexts to build interpretations relating to the minds of
others.

* Reading mind from heartrate
<<group16>>

The previous chapter argues that human interpretations are central to the study
of how models of minds might operate in the course of life. Building on this
argument, the present chapter seeks to uncover what users believe basic
biosensors can capture about the minds of others. Through a vignette experiment
and a mixed-methods experimental study, this chapter show how people use
biosensory data (heartrate) in social, computer-mediated contexts to build
interpretations relating to the minds of others.

** Background

As of 2016, several apps allow users to share their heartrate with their
friends, leading some cite:McNell2015 to wonder why anyone would anyone want to do such a
thing. In fact, heartrate is a potentially rich signal for designers. The
meaning of a heartrate in any given context is at once socially informative 
cite:Frey2016a,Slovak2012
and highly ambiguous 
cite:Merrill2010a.

After all, heartrate is not just some number. The sense of one’s heartbeat is an
integral feature of the human experience, and people’s associations with it
range from intimacy cite:Janssen2010 to anxiety cite:Decaria1974 to sexual
arousal cite:Valins1966. Many heartrate sharing applications rely on these
associations, asking users to ascribe contextual meanings to heartrate
cite:Kastrenakes2014,Slovak2012, often with the aim of increasing intimacy
cite:Janssen2010. The advertising copy for Cardiogr.am, one smartwatch app, reads,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Your heart beats 102,000 times per day, and it reacts to everything that happens
in your life—what you're eating, how you exercise, a stressful moment, or a
happy memory. What's your heart telling you?
#+END_QUOTE

These applications, along with many others, rely on the fact
that people will imbue their heartrate data with emotional, and highly
contextual interpretations. Given the relatively large number of wearables with
embedded heartrate monitors (watches, bands, even earbuds) cite:Stables2016, it
is unsurprising that designers are looking beyond fitness and health for ways to
increase user engagement with these devices. However, it is not clear how
individuals will interpret a shared biosignal (e.g. heartrate) in different
contexts of social interaction.

This chapter examines what heartrate can mean as a computer-mediated cue, and
how interpretations of heartrate affect social attitudes and social behavior as
people assign meanings to these signals relevant to the mind (emotion, mood,
trust).

First, we use a vignette experiment to investigate how individuals make social
interpretations about a rudimentary biosignal (heartrate) in conditions of
uncertainty, focusing on dyadic interactions between acquaintances. Dyadic
relations, which are present in all groups, function as a fundamental starting
point for understanding interpersonal collaboration and group interactions
cite:Cheshire2010. We describe the quantitative and qualitative results of a
randomized vignette experiment in which subjects make assessments about an
acquaintance based on an imagined scenario that included shared heartrate
information. We examine two contexts in this study: an uncertain,
non-adversarial context and an uncertain, adversarial context. These two
contexts, differing only by a few words, ask participants to imagine they are
meeting someone "for a movie" (non-adversarial) or "to discuss a legal dispute”
(adversarial).

We find that a high heartrate transmits negative cues about mood in both
contexts of interaction, but that these cues do not appear to impact assessments
of trustworthiness, reliability or dependability. Counter to our initial
predictions, we find that normal (rather than elevated) heartrate leads to
negative trust-related assessments, but only in the adversarial context. In
qualitative assessments of subjects’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that normal
heartrate in the adversarial condition conflicts with expectations about how the
participant believes the acquaintance should feel, signaling a lack of concern
or seriousness, which appears to lead individuals to view the acquaintance as
less trustworthy. In contrast, subjects in the non-adversarial context relate
elevated heartrate to empathy and identification rather than trustworthiness. We
also find a small number of subjects read different social interpretations onto
the heartrate signal, including a very small minority who did not infer any
relationship between the heartrate and the social situation.

*** Sharing sensor data

To date, most work on the contextual interpretation of sensor data has focused
on individual interpretation of individual data (c.f. quantified self). In
contrast, our work attempts to move toward an understanding of how biosignals
are interpreted in interpersonal interactions – the quantified social self. This
shift is motivated, in part, by an increasing number of consumer applications
that support sharing biosignals such as heartrate. Especially pertinent to our
study, it is not well understood what heartrate actually signals to another
person in a social interaction. How might the contextual, social interpretation
of another person's biosignals affect social interpretations of mood (e.g.,
anxiety, calmness), or attitudes about trustworthiness and dependability?

Goffman cite:Goffmann1959 (p 56) makes an important distinction between the cues
that we intend to give to others, and those that are “given off” unintentionally
through our numerous non-verbal actions and behaviors. We view physiological
signals such as heartrate as a form of non-verbal signaling that can “give off”
more information to others than the sender may desire cite:Howell2016. This type
of personal data revealed through discreet sensors paired with mobile
communication technologies has, until recently, been unavailable in most forms
of social interaction.

*** Sharing physiological data


Prior work interrogates the contextual interpretation of personal data from
certain kinds of sensors cite:Choe2011a,Consolvo2005, but physiological data has
received less attention, despite two crucial differences from sensors that
capture information such as location (e.g., GPS). First, biosensor data are
intrinsically ambiguous: whereas a GPS coordinate refers to one specific place,
heartrates do not have oneto-one mappings to physical activities or emotions.
Second, physiological phenomena vary from person to person; 60bpm could be high
or low depending on whose heartrate it is. A relatively large body of work has
looked at how the transmission of physiological data might play a role in
computermediated communication. One class of application has attempted to
explicitly encourage or discourage certain behavioral outcomes, making some
biosignals apparent such that the transmission of the data acts as a social cue
cite:Bergstrom2011. Another class of prototypes explores how signals might
affect feelings of intimacy, particularly between romantic partners
cite:Bell2003, and several applications focus on the transmission of heartrate
as a means to achieve this effect cite:Janssen2010,McNell2015.

*** Sharing heartrate

Heartrate has deep-rooted cultural significance in many societies, and
near-universal familiarity as a feature of our lived experiences. Building on
associations with intimacy and love, many heartrate sharing applications have
aimed to “enhance” social connectedness by fostering feelings of intimacy
cite:Janssen2010,hassibheartchat between people.

What heartrate means as a computer-mediated cue, however, is ambiguous, its
potential interpretations varying widely in different contexts
cite:Lotan2007,Slovak2012. Boehner et al (2007) argue for the intrinsic
ambiguity of sensor data as a resource in design, particularly in systems that
seek to use these data to express emotion cite:Boehner2007b. Many technology
probes corroborate this stance, relying on users to project socially contextual
meanings around a transmitted heartrate. Consequently, more recent work has
challenged the notion that the social consequences of transmitting physiological
data will always result in increased trust and intimacy. There remains little
work, however, on how the potential ambiguity of a heartrate signal is resolved
in social conditions of risk and uncertainty.

** Vignette experiment

This section describes the quantitative and qualitative results of a randomized
vignette experiment in which subjects were asked to make assessments about an
acquaintance based on an imagined scenario that included shared heartrate
information. We compare the results of this experiment in adversarial and
non-adversarial contexts of interaction. We find that elevated heartrate
transmits cues about mood in both contexts, but that these cues do not appear to
impact assessments of trustworthiness, reliability and dependability. Counter to
our expectations, we find that normal (rather than elevated) heartrate leads to
negative trust-related assessments, but only in an adversarial context. Our
qualitative analysis points to the role of social expectations in shaping
contextual interpretations of heartrate, and reveals individual differences in
the way interpretations are constructed. We unpack some of the ways that social
meanings can arise from biosensor data, and discuss considerations for those
designing interactions with wearables.

Compared to social interpretations of physiological signals, interpretations of
one’s own signals are slightly better-understood from empirical research.
Individuals’ interpretations of their own heartrate have received particular
attention (see cite:Parkinson1985 for a review). Studies have generally revealed
that, when individuals believe that their heartrate is elevated, they sometimes
believe their mood and emotions to be more negative cite:Young1982a.

If lay interpretations of one’s own heartrate can yield negative
self-interpretations, sharing heartrate information could also yield negative
effects on mood and trustworthiness, particularly during uncertain interactions
where something is at stake (such as time, money, or other valued resources). To
investigate, we use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and
qualitative analyses of a survey-based vignette experiment.

*** Hypotheses

Based on aforementioned studies of individual's negative emotional
interpretation of their own heartrate, we believe that this negative valence
will be mirrored in people’s interpretations of the heartrates of others in
uncertain situations. Our investigation begins with two key predictions about
negative assessments of one’s partner in an uncertain social situation. We test
both hypotheses in two different contexts of interaction (adversarial and
non-adversarial) to understand how the context of risk and uncertainty affects
social interpretations of heartrate.

# Heartrate and Mood
Past work indicates that people tend to make negative inferences about mood and
emotion from elevated heartrates cite:Decaria1974,Gu2012,Young1982. As such, our
first hypothesis predicts that participants will adjust their attitudes about
the mood of their partner when their partner’s heartrate is elevated, as opposed
to normal: Hypothesis 1: When individuals believe that their partner has an
elevated heartrate in an uncertain social interaction, they will report their
partner as being (1a), less calm (1b), more emotional (1c), and more easily
upset (1d), compared to those who believe that their partner has a normal
heartrate.

# Heartrate and Trustworthiness

Where Hypothesis 1 predicts that individuals will make negative assessments
about an acquaintance’s mood based on elevated heartrate, our second hypothesis
predicts that individuals will make negative assessments about dispositions to
behave in a reliable, dependable and trustworthy manner. Thus, both hypotheses
stem from the same base assumption that, all things being equal, elevated
heartrate has a primarily negative connotation with attitudes and behaviors of
another person. Hypothesis 2: When individuals believe that their partner has an
elevated heartrate in an uncertain social interaction, they will make negative
assessments about the partner’s trustworthiness (2a), reliability (2b), and
dependability (2c), compared to those who believe that their partner has a
normal heartrate.

*** Methods

To test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey-based vignette experiment.
Vignette studies involve short descriptions of a scenario, designed to elucidate
opinions, attitudes, and beliefs about that particular situation cite:Jenkins2010.

In this vignette study, we compare two different contexts of interaction. We do
not create separate hypotheses for the two different contexts; rather, we are
interested in comparing and contrasting the two different contexts to see how
they might interact with social interpretations of heartrate. We provide our
participants with either an adversarial or a non-adversarial social context. In
the adversarial scenario, the participant is waiting to meet an acquaintance
about a legal dispute. In the non-adversarial scenario, the participant is
waiting at a movie theater for an acquaintance so that they can see a film
together.

In all scenarios, the acquaintance sends a message via smartphone indicating
that he or she is running late due to slow traffic. The person who is waiting
does not know if the acquaintance will make it on time or not, or whether the
acquaintance is being honest about their tardiness. Within each context, we
manipulate a small piece of information about the heartrate of the acquaintance:
We tell the participant that the heartrate of the acquaintance has been shared
by the acquaintances’ smartphone and it is either elevated or normal.

# Sample
Our sample was undergraduate students recruited from the population of a large,
public university on the West Coast of the U.S. Potential participants were
asked to participate in a short online survey, and they did not know the nature
of the questions or the topic of the study in advance. All participants were
paid a $5 Amazon gift card. One hundred and three participants (103) completed
the experiment survey instrument. The pool was weighted toward women; in our
sample, 65% were women and 34% are male, and 2% (2 subjects) did not identify
with either gender. With random assignment, the same overall gender split was
maintained across conditions. The mean age of participants was 23.

# Vignettes
Each participant in the study saw only one of the four possible vignettes. After
the vignette, the survey included free response questions about subjects'
reactions to and interpretations of the situation described in the vignette, as
well as 7-point Likert scale questions (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) in
which subjects evaluated the other person's disposition (“This person is
emotional”, “This person is anxious”, “This person is easily upset”, and “This
person is calm”). In addition, we asked participants to indicate whether the
other person was “trustworthy,” “reliable,” and “dependable” using the same 7-
point agreement scale.

There are two contexts of interaction (adversarial and nonadversarial) and two
heartrate conditions (normal and elevated), creating four distinct vignettes
based on social context and heartrate (HR): adversarial elevated HR, adversarial
normal HR, non-adversarial elevated HR, and non-adversarial normal HR.
Participants were randomly assigned into one of the four conditions. We
manipulated these heartrate conditions by making a key wording change as
indicated in the two context vignettes below.

#+END_QUOTE

** Quantitative results

We apply both quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate our research
questions and hypotheses. The study is based around an experimental design, but
we also place significant emphasis on open-ended responses to better understand
participants’ thought processes, beliefs, and rationale for their choices in the
vignettes. Our first hypothesis predicts that individuals will make negative
attributions about the mood of the acquaintance in this uncertain situation when
they believe that the acquaintance has an elevated heartrate (compared to normal
heartrate). Given our four separate measures of mood, we conducted a
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test the hypothesis that there are
one or more mean differences between the normal/elevated heartrate conditions,
and/or between the two contexts of interaction (nonadversarial and adversarial).

We found a strong, statistically significant effect and a medium practical
association between emotional attributions and heartrate condition, F (4, 96) =
32.89, p < .001; partial eta squared = .58. Turning to the individual outcomes,
we find that subjects’ perceptions of the acquaintance in the vignette’s
anxiety, his/her tendency to be easily upset, his/her tendency to be emotional,
and his/her lack of calmness were all significantly higher in the elevated
heartrate conditions when compared to the normal heartrate conditions (see
Figure [[fig:mood-attitude]]). We found no significant effect for the two contexts
of interaction, F (4, 96) = 1.072, p = .38, and no significant effect for the
context x heartrate condition interaction, F (4, 96) = 1.65, p = .17. In sum,
individuals significantly rate acquaintances with elevated heartrate as more
anxious, easily upset, and less calm than those with normal heartrates. In the
non-adversarial context, individuals did not rate the acquaintances as
significantly more emotional in the elevated condition compared to normal, but
this difference was statistically significant in the adversarial context.

The context of interaction (non-adversarial, adversarial) does not have any
effect on mood ratings. With clear statistical and practical significance for
the overall effect of mood attributions by heartrate condition in both contexts
of interaction, Hypothesis 1 is supported.

Our second hypothesis predicts that individuals will make negative assessments
about how certain they are regarding the acquaintances’ trustworthiness
characteristics when the individual has an elevated versus a normal heartrate.
We find a statistically and practically significant effect for the heartrate
conditions, F (3, 97) = 4.19, p < .01; partial eta squared = .12. However, we also
find statistically significant effects for both the context of interaction, F
(3, 97) = 2.82, p < .05, and the context x heartrate condition interaction, F
(3, 97) = 2.75, p < .05.

A closer inspection of the individual mean differences reveals that the means
for all three outcomes (reliability, dependability and trustworthiness) are all
lower in the normal condition compared to the elevated condition in the
adversarial context (see Figure [[fig:trust-attitude]]). This result is the opposite of what
Hypothesis 2 predicts. In the non-adversarial context, we find no statistically
significant differences in trust-related evaluations between heartrate
conditions. Thus, it is the interaction between the context and the heartrate
condition that explains the results: individuals rate acquaintances with normal
heartrates significantly lower in terms of trustworthiness, dependability and
reliability than those with higher heartrates—but only in the adversarial
condition.

Individuals do not rate acquaintances any differently on these three outcomes
between the heartrate conditions within the nonadversarial context. In fact, the
means for these outcomes are very similar across all conditions and contexts,
with the sole exception of the adversarial, normal condition. The mean
differences for the trust-related outcomes between the normal and the elevated
conditions within the adversarial context are all highly statistically
significant (p < .01) and highly practically significant: Cohen’s d = 1.1
(trustworthiness); 1.07 (dependability); 0.68 (reliability). Hypothesis 2 is
therefore not supported. However, the strong findings (statistically and
practically significant) in the opposite direction from our prediction warrant
further exploration in the qualitative results and discussion below.

** Qualitative results
Directly after the vignette, participants were asked four freeresponse questions
about their reactions to the situation described in the vignette: 1) How do you
react to this message, 2) What makes you react this way, 3) What is the ideal
outcome of this situation, and 4) What is the worst possible outcome of this
situation? The open-field responses were coded into two broad, non-overlapping
categories: those that mentioned a negative emotional reaction to the scenario,
and those that included a mention of what the other person in the situation
might be thinking or feeling. Responses in the latter category were further
sub-divided by experimental condition for analysis.

*** Adversarial Context

This section reports on the qualitative analysis of free responses given by
subjects in the adversarial (legal dispute) context.

*** Normal heartrate


#+NAME: fig:mood-attitude
#+CAPTION: Mood-related evaluation means by condition (bars represent standard deviation).
[[./figures/acmgroup-mood.png]]

#+NAME: fig:trust-attitude
#+CAPTION: Trust-related evaluation means by condition (bars represent standard deviation).
[[./figures/acmgroup-trust.png]]

In the adversarial (legal dispute) context, many subjects who saw a normal
heartrate directly indicated that they were negatively adjusting their appraisal
of the other person, either in their sympathy toward the other person, or in
their judgment of that person’s trustworthiness. We find that normal heartrate
in the adversarial condition appears to be in conflict with the subjects’
expectations about how the acquaintance should feel.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will feel less sympathetic to this person because their heart rate doesn’t
show that they are stressed or upset.

I feel annoyed because a higher heart rate would indicate that the person cares
about the meeting

The normal heartrate implies that my acquaintance isn’t taking this meeting
seriously. However, it is difficult to say that my acquaintance does not care or
is lying. For example, I have no knowledge of the traffic to determine if my
acquaintance is lying.
#+END_QUOTE

Here, participants read a lack of care or concern into the acquaintance’s normal
heartrate, but did not feel the biosignal provided definitive evidence as to
whether or not the acquaintance was being truthful. For some participants,
however, normal heartrate indicated deception:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I would think this person is lying. If they were in a rush, their heartrate
would be faster.

I feel like he is lying and is taking his time. I say "hurry up please I can’t
wait any longer. You are lying to me" It makes me angry to see that his
heartrate is normal through all of this. Mine is spiking out of control.
#+END_QUOTE

These responses could help to explain the surprising quantitative results of
Hypothesis 2 in the adversarial context: the intersection of the adversarial
context with normal heartrate led many participants to view the acquaintance as
unsympathetic and, in some cases, disingenuous. As we see below, these negative
reactions stand in stark contrast to the interpretations in the elevated
heartrate condition.

*** Elevated heartrate

In general, participants in the adversarial context viewed elevated
heartrate as a signal that the acquaintance cared about being late.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Since it shows that the person is trying their best to come, as
shown by the elevated heartrate, I would still feel ok.

I would believe my acquaintance. An elevated heartrate tells me
she is probably rushing/hurrying over. I have data from the phone
to validate what she is saying to a certain extent.
#+END_QUOTE

In these quotes, participants used the elevated heartrate to validate
their acquaintance’s claim, thus positively assessing their honesty.
A few subjects spoke to the power of data in creating what
appeared to be objective facts about the other person.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I won’t be angry because seeing this person’s heart rate being
elevated, it must mean they’re in a hurry. Seeing metrics make it
easier to believe someone.

I feel like I’m in a position of power. With the capacity to check
someone’s heart rate, I can instantly tell how they are feeling. In a
way, it is almost like a lie detector.
#+END_QUOTE

In both of these quotes, we see attitudes about the presumed
authority or “neutrality” of data interacting with beliefs about the
body (namely, the relationship between heartrate and emotion, or
truthfulness), creating a context in which wearables data can be
used to construct social judgments or assessments. How these
assessments play out will vary in different social situations, with
different sensors, and in different contexts of use. Such variations
should be explored much more deeply in future work.

*** Non-Adversarial Context

This section reports on the qualitative analysis of subjects in the
non-adversarial context (meeting for a movie).

*** Normal heartrate

In the non-adversarial context, many participants reported that
normal heartrate conveyed a lack of appropriate social concern:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At first I believe that maybe my acquaintance is running late;
however, when I discover that their heart rate is normal I wonder
why it isn't higher…

It seems like they are too nonchalant about it

I feel frustrated because it seems like the person isn't concerned
about making me wait.
#+END_QUOTE

In these cases, interpretations focused on what the other person
was thinking or feeling. As we saw in the adversarial context,
normal heartrate seems to be in conflict with expectations.
However, unlike in the adversarial context, we did not find
evidence that subjects were re-appraising their trust toward the
other person. Interestingly, two participants read the normal
heartrate positively, as a sign that the other person was telling the
truth.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If his heartrate is normal, then he is probably not lying. I would
still be slightly annoyed at this.

it’s OK. her heartbeat was normal, so no lies
#+END_QUOTE

These subjects seemed to feel annoyed by the partner’s normal heartrate.
However, in contrast to the adversarial context, no subjects explicitly stated
that the other person seemed less trustworthy, honest or reliable as a result.

*** Elevated heartrate
The majority of respondents in the non-adversarial indicated that
the elevated heartrate was a token of the other person’s regret for
being late to the movie. Many participants in this condition
indicated that they would have a more sympathetic reaction to the
text message as a result of seeing an elevated heartrate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Elevated heart rate tells me that the acquaintance at least cares
that he/she is late and there's no point in getting mad.

I would text her back "No problem! I'll grab the tickets and will
wait for you out front." It seems obvious she's in a hurry to get
there, and is late because of traffic.

I will feel apologetic because I can see that this person's heartrate
is elevated and I do no want him/her to feel worried/ stressed
about making a movie.

I would feel anxiety about being late for the movie and pity
because they seem anxious. I don't like being rushed and get
anxious when I am rushed
#+END_QUOTE

In these responses, heartrate generally seemed to signal that the acquaintance
was stressed. While stress is generally assumed to be negative, in this case it
seems to engender identification and empathy with the acquaintance. This example
gestures toward the highly contextual nature of heartrate’s social meaning, and
why more work should examine the consequences of these different
interpretations.

*** Other interpretations of heartrate: Relevance, validity, creepiness

In addition to the major themes noted above, we also found a few
other important interpretations. A small handful of participants 
(12 total) mentioned aspects other than the immediate social
interaction in relation to the shared heartrate display. The points
that surfaced surrounded concerns about privacy, doubts about the
accuracy of the sensing device, and doubts about the relevance of
heartrate to the particular context.

# Privacy and disclosure concerns

Only three subjects in the entire experiment pool (n=103)
commented on the potential for invasiveness or over-disclosure in
heartrate sharing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(non-adversarial + normal heartrate) ``I feel like I'm violating my
acquaintance's private information by knowing their heart beat.''

(adversarial + normal heartrate) ``I do suspect the person is lying
since his heart rate is normal. I think the extra info of the heart
rate is the reason I have a neg. suggestion towards the person. I
think the reported heart rate is a bad idea.''
#+END_QUOTE

Given that heartrate sharing is not (yet) widely deployed in
consumer devices, it is somewhat surprising that only a few
subjects commented on privacy concerns. This could be partially
explained by the fact that the scenario was imagined, rather that
simulated, and because subjects might have anticipated our
interest in their reactions to the interface.

Validity of the device’s data

Four subjects mentioned the possibility that the device, or the
intuitive inferences drawn from it, may be inaccurate.
(adversarial + elevated heartrate) Heart rate could be elevated
for many reasons, and just like studies with lie detectors, it may
possibly indicate lying, but also could indicate other things. It’s
just a number, not a definite answer of lying or not. And even
then, you’ve got to forgive people.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(adversarial + normal heartrate) ``The normal heartrate implies that my
acquaintance isn’t taking this meeting seriously. However, it is difficult to
say that my acquaintance does not care or is lying. For example, I have no
knowledge of the traffic to determine if my acquaintance is lying. Additionally,
my smartphone can be wrong; I don’t know how accurate this technology is,
especially since it is a very new piece of technology.''
#+END_QUOTE

Our study did not reference any existing device, so it is possible that the
fallibility of particular devices was not on subjects’ minds. However, the trust
that people place in sensing devices, and the presumed authority of their data,
should be explored thoroughly in future work.

Only two subjects in the study who mentioned heartrate felt that the data
was not necessarily related to the specific social situation described in the
vignette:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(non-adversarial / elevated heartrate) ``My initial reaction would
probably be to ask them if everything is okay. Their heart rate
should probably not be elevated since they are only driving and
weather conditions are not abnormal.''

(adversarial / normal heartrate) ``There may be reasons why
his/her heartrate is normal and why he/she may be late in the first
place, so I'm not concerned about that.''
#+END_QUOTE

Across all conditions, the fact that the vast majority of participants
inferred a causal relationship between the heartrate information
and the particular social situation highlights the relatively reliable
effect of context in priming subjects to draw such inferences. Our
results indicate that simply making the heartrate salient, in the
absence of other cues, invites people to project a causal narrative
on the mood, intentions, and behavior of others.

** Discussion

We began this investigation by asking how individuals might interpret heartrate
information in uncertain social interactions. Our hypotheses are both based on
the simple rationalization that the kinds of negative attributions that people
tend to make about their own heartrate will be echoed in their social
interpretations of others’ heartrates in uncertain contexts. We found, however,
a much more complex story about the social interpretation of biosignals and the
context of interaction.

Our first hypothesis predicts that an elevated heartrate will be negatively
associated with assessments about mood and dispositions in uncertain social
interactions, both adversarial and non-adversarial. We found strong support for
this hypothesis in both contexts, across our outcome attributions, in line with
prior works’ findings regarding interpretation of one’s own heartrate cite:Young1982. Our
second hypothesis predicts that an elevated heartrate will lead to negative
assessments about the partners’ trustworthiness, dependability and reliability.
As with our first hypothesis, we expected that pre-existing negative
connotations with heartrate might translate into negative expectations of
trustrelated behavior.

We rejected the second hypothesis in both contexts of interaction. In the
non-adversarial context, we found no difference in assessments of
trustworthiness, dependability or reliability in the elevated and normal
heartrate conditions. Furthermore, we found that the average assessments on
these three outcomes were nearly identical between the elevated condition in the
adversarial context and the elevated and normal conditions in the
non-adversarial context.

Most surprisingly, we find a decrease in trustworthiness, dependability, and
reliability in the normal heartrate condition, but only in the adversarial
context. As noted in the quantitative results, the differences between the
elevated and normal conditions in the adversarial context were highly
statistically significant: each of the trust-related measures saw an average
decrease of one full point (on a 7-point scale) in the normal condition compared
to the elevated condition.

To help explain these results, we turn to our qualitative analyses of the
adversarial (legal dispute) context. Subjects in the adversarial context seemed
to have expected their partner to have an elevated heartrate. When the partner
had a normal heartrate, participants viewed it as evidence that s/he is not
bothered enough, not taking the situation seriously, or perhaps even lying.
Indeed, many participants explicitly stated in the open text responses that they
trusted the partner less because his or her heartrate was normal.

Why do we not see the same effect in the non-adversarial context? Turning again
to the qualitative data, we find that participants took elevated heartrate as a
token of their acquaintances’ genuine desire to arrive on time. It seems that
elevated heartrate led many participants in the non-adversarial context to
increase their empathy, identification, and understanding of the partners’
situation. Thus, even though individuals in the non-adversarial condition
associate elevated heartrate with anxiety, lack of calmness, and being easily
upset, the negative emotional interpretations do not seem to translate to
evaluations of one’s trustworthiness, dependability or reliability.

Taken together, we see that heartrate does not inherently (or consistently)
affect trust-related outcomes. Instead, social expectations shape
interpretations of the heartrate biosignal to create highly contextual,
socially-specific meanings. CMC researchers have long noted that, when cues are
omitted from technology-mediated interaction, people tend to fill in the gaps
[3,10]. However, individuals may interpret new types of interpersonal data in
ways we do not yet understand. Our work provides some evidence that such
interpretations might have real social consequences. The fact that heartrate
alone can significantly alter one’s perception of trustworthiness in an
adversarial context is an important step towards the larger goal of unpacking
social interpretations (and their effects) in technologysupported social
interaction. (For one thing, the mostly positive social interpretations of
heartrate observed in past work are likely highly dependent on the social
context in which they were observed).

Finally, we note a diversity of opinions and interpretations within conditions.
For example, a few subjects took normal heartrate as proof of honesty, the
opposite view from the majority of subjects. A few subjects did not feel there
was necessarily any relationship between heartrate and the social situation at
hand. A small minority (three subjects) mentioned concerns around privacy or
disclosure. The wide range of views, sometimes contradictory, highlights the
complexity intrinsic to interfaces that collect and share biosignals, and
warrants future studies into social and contextual interpretation of data from
wearable devices.

** Conclusions

Our vignette experiment examined a single type of scenario in two different
contexts, using text-based answers. We still have a limited picture of the range
of theoretically important contexts in which individuals may observe and
interpret biosignals about others, and a limited understanding of how the rich
cues present in realistic interaction contexts might bare on our findings. Our
study focused on a first-time interaction with an imagined heartrate sharing
interface. We do not know how our findings would hold over time, and it is very
likely that social meanings of any biosignal could become more consistent over
time. The vignette scenario was contrived from believable, but currently
non-existent smartphone technology. Either due to participants’ suspension of
their disbelief or due to their actual attitudes about the heartrate sharing,
few participants raised questions regarding privacy implications of these
scenarios.

Since the vignette study took place online, we could have missed the sorts of
rich contextual cues that might be captured by live interviews or other
in-person methods. Furthermore, the internet presents a wide array of
distractions to survey-takers, and our survey was not able to detect the
participants' attention on the task (e.g.., we could not detect whether the
subject was switching between tabs in their web browser, or taking breaks during
the survey), nor did we monitor how long subjects spent filling out the survey.

While this vignette experiment provides evidence that interpretations of
biosignals from sensors (such as wearables) can affect social attributions and
behaviors towards others. Nevertheless, many questions remain. While this study
examined social beliefs as they relate to heartrate, it did not examine how (or
if) these beliefs affect social behaviors. Furthermore, we did not examine how
specific our findings are to heartrate. What other signals from the body might
lead to social interpretations?

In the following chapter, we begin to address these limitations through a
controlled, behavioral experiments, which helps us ask more specific questions
about how elevated heartrate affects perceptions of risk in uncertain
interactions, e.g. when money is at stake. This study study leads to a more
robust understanding of how the transmission of basic biosignals might affect
social behavior.

* Biosignals, mind and behavior
<<cscw17>>

From the prior chapter's findings about social attitudes, this chapter moves to
an lab-based experiment to understand how shared heartrate effects social
behavior. We apply quantitative and qualitative analyses to an iterated
prisoner's dilemma game, in which heartrate information (“elevated” or “normal”)
was shared between players. In a follow-up study, we replicate our initial
study, but replace heartrate with an unfamiliar biosignal, ``Skin Reflectivity
Index (SRI).''

We find that both heartrate and the unfamiliar biosignal are associated with
negative mood attributions, but we observe a decrease in cooperative behavior
only with elevated heartrate. Qualitative results indicate that individuals may
learn an association between our unfamiliar biosignal and the cooperative,
trusting behavior of their partner. Our findings highlight the role prior
beliefs can play in shaping interpretations of a biosignal, while suggesting
that designers can, perhaps inadvertently, train users to associate signals with
social meanings.

Our results raise important questions for applications that transmit
sensor-derived signals socially between users. For signals with strong cultural
associations, people’s prior beliefs will color their interpretations, and
social outcomes may or may not be positive. In the case of novel signals, on the
other hand, our results imply that designers can (perhaps inadvertently) teach
users to associate these biosignals with social meanings. This effect could be
viewed as beneficial, depending on design objectives. It could also be dangerous
if designers suggest, perhaps even inadvertently, interpretations that lead to
discrimination.

# something here to tease how this fits into larger argument, or nah?

** Lab-based experiment

Following our vignette experiment, which focused on social attitudes, we extend
our inquiry to a trust-building game, which will allow us to study social
behavior. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we find that "elevated"
(versus “normal”) heartrate of an exchange partner is associated with negative
mood attributions and reduced cooperation in a social dilemma game. To
investigate how specific our findings are to heartrate (as opposed to some other
"elevated" signal collected from the body), we replicate our initial experiment
with an unfamiliar biosignal, “skin reflectivity”. We find that both heartrate
and the unfamiliar biosignal are associated with negative mood attributions, but
we observe a decrease in cooperative behavior only with elevated heartrate.
Qualitative results indicate that individuals may learn an association between
our unfamiliar biosignal and the cooperative, trusting behavior of their
partner. Our findings highlight the role prior beliefs can play in shaping
interpretations of a biosignal, while suggesting that designers can, perhaps
inadvertently, train users to associate signals with social meanings. We discuss
implications for how wearable sensors can mediate social interactions.

# _TODO remind that we just talked about this in the last exp_
Generally when individuals believe that their heartrate is elevated, they often
believe their mood and emotions to be more negative. Thus, we apply this same
logic to how individuals will interpret the elevated heartrates of others in
uncertain social interactions:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
H1. Participants who see a consistently elevated heartrate from their partner
will rate their partner more negatively on mood attributes, compared to
participants who see a consistently normal heartrate in uncertain and risky
social interactions.
#+END_QUOTE

If elevated heartrate has a negative connotation with mood, then elevated
heartrate may increase uncertainty about the behavior of one’s partner as well.
When people know that their partner has an elevated heartrate in an uncertain,
risky interactions, they may take actions to protect themselves against
potential losses. In trust-building situations, individuals take small risks
with other people (entrustment behavior) and learn whether the other person
honors that trust or not (cooperative behavior). Thus, individuals have two
different ways to respond to increased uncertainty about their partners’
behavior in trust situations: 1) reduce the amount they entrust to their
partners, or 2) decrease their willingness to cooperate with the partner
cite:Cheshire2010,Cook2005. Since we expect elevated heartrate to have
pre-existing connotations with negative attributes, we predict that individuals
will entrust and/or cooperate less to protect themselves from potential harm
when the partner has an elevated vs. a normal heartrate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
H2. Participants who see an elevated heartrate from their partner will (a) trust
less, and (b) cooperate less with the partner in uncertain and risky social
interactions compared to participants who see a normal heartrate.
#+END_QUOTE

** Sharing heartrate in a risky, uncertain interaction

In order to test our hypotheses, we conducted a repeated
trust experiment with shared heartrate information. Trust
games present participants with financial incentives to pay
attention to their partner’s decisions over time, and provide
means for operationalizing trust and cooperation in the
presence of uncertainty cite:Cheshire2010.

The overall design of the trust game involves anonymous
pairs of fixed partners making repeated decisions to entrust
valued resources to the partner, and to return (cooperate) or
keep (defect) the points entrusted by the other partner.
Importantly, individuals can make the highest amount of
money when they entrust many points to a partner and the
partner returns these points. This creates an uncertain social
situation in which participants are trying to earn real money
by repeatedly taking risks (entrusting points) to a partner.
Since the partners are making the same decisions to entrust
and keep/return points from the other partner, these are
mutually-dependent social interactions.

*** Experimental Design and Methods

#+NAME: fig:hr-monitor
#+CAPTION: The heartrate monitor. Participants were told to place their finger on the monitor to take a reading while viewing their partner’s decisions during the previous turn.
[[./figures/cscw-hr-monitor.jpg]]

We operationalized an uncertain social interaction situation using a trust game
called the Prisoner’s Dilemma with Dependence (PDD) cite:Cheshire2010,Cook2005.
The PDD game allows individuals to control the amount of risk that they want to
take with their partner by choosing how many points to entrust, followed by a
second decision to either keep or return whatever has been entrusted by their
partner. Thus, the PDD game separates trust behavior (choosing how much to
entrust to a partner) from cooperative behavior (choosing to return or keep what
a partner entrusted). In each round of the PDD game, participants were given an
initial endowment of 10 points. Each participant decided whether to entrust any
number of points to their partner, from zero to ten. Then, participants found
out at the same time whether their partner had entrusted them with any of their
own points, and if so, how many. Next, each participant decided whether to keep
the points entrusted to them (defection) or return them (cooperation). The
participants could not return only a portion of the entrusted points, only all
or none of them. If the points were returned to the partner, they were
automatically doubled in value for that participant.

After all participants made decisions about returning or keeping any points that
had been entrusted to them, they were then asked to place their finger on the
heartrate monitor for a few seconds in order to get a pulse reading (Figure [[fig:hr-monitor]]).
Participants then viewed the summary of point calculations for the round.
Subsequently, participants viewed a visual display of the partners’ recent
heartrate (Figure [[fig:hr-viz]]). The final point calculation for the round included any of
the initial allotment of points remaining after the trust decision, plus and
points that the participant kept from their partner if they decided not to
return them. In addition, players received points for any entrusted points that
their partner returned, which doubled in value.

When participants arrived at the laboratory, they were given a consent form that
described the nature of the study, as well as the human subjects’ approval
information from our university. We wanted participants to believe that they
would be interacting with other real people, and this perception was enhanced by
having 12-16 participants at separate computer terminals in the same large room
during each experimental session. In fact, we controlled the trust and
cooperation behavior of the “partner” for every participant using a simulated
computer actor. As a result, no one in the study interacted with a human
partner.

The simulated actor was programmed to always begin by entrusting one point on
the first round, then randomly entrust up to one point above or below whatever
the partner entrusted on the previous round. In addition, the simulated actor
was programmed to always cooperate (i.e., return the points that were entrusted
by the partner). Following
cite:Cheshire2010,
we chose to use a highly cooperative interaction
partner in order to minimize any other forms of uncertainty in the interaction.
A highly-cooperation partner does not introduce any defection behaviors that
might otherwise reduce cooperation or trust from the participant (thereby
hindering our ability to detect main effects from the experimental
manipulation). Thus, the simulated actor was designed to reciprocate the
entrusting behavior of the human participant on each round, and always cooperate
no matter what the human participant chose to do.

The participants completed 20 rounds of the PDD game, but they did not know how
many rounds they would play in order to eliminate end-game effects. After all
rounds of the PDD game were completed, participants answered a short
post-questionnaire in order to assess their attitudes and beliefs about their
partner. This questionnaire included 7- point Likert-style response questions (1
= strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) about the partners’ beliefs about the
partners’ anxiety (e.g., “my partner is anxious” and “my partner is calm”).

As a manipulation check on the perceptions of the simulated actor’s behavior, we
also asked questions about the partners’ game behavior (“my partner is
trustworthy” and “my partner is cooperative”). Finally, we supplemented our
quantitative measures with two open-ended questions: “How would you describe
your partner?” and “What, if anything, did heartrate tell you about your partner
during this experiment?” Participants were paid between $15-30 based on their
point earnings during the game. The entire study lasted one hour.

#+NAME: fig:hr-viz
#+CAPTION: The heartrate visualization. After viewing the results of the previous round, participants saw a graph of what they believed to be their partner’s heartrate, either normal (left) or elevated (right). Error bars fluctuated within pre-set bounds.
[[./figures/cscw-hr-viz.png]]

At the end of the study, participants were debriefed on the true nature and
intent of the experiment. An experimenter was available at the end of the study
in case of any questions, and we provided participants with the researchers’
email addresses on both the signed informed consent form, as well as the debrief
form, so that they could contact us regarding any aspect of the study. We did
not receive any emails or concerns from participants.

*** Experimental Manipulation

To assess the effect of interacting with a partner who has an
elevated heartrate versus interacting with a partner who has
a normal heartrate, we controlled the heartrate information
that participants saw after each round of the experiment.
This created a two-condition design: always normal
heartrate (NH) and always elevated heartrate (EH).

*** Participants and Procedure

Our sample was undergraduate students recruited from the population of a large
west coast public university in the United States. We contacted potential
participants via email from a voluntary experimental subject pool. All
participants expected to be contacted to participate in a social research study
at some point during the semester, and knew that they would earn between $15-30
during this one-hour study, depending on their choices during the experiment.
Fifty-six participants (56) completed the experiment, 41 women, 14 men, and one
self-identified as other. The mean age of participants was 21.

Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants were guided to an individual desk
with privacy walls. After signing an informed consent form, participants read
written instructions on the computer which explained that they will have the
opportunity to interact with a single partner for many rounds in order to
examine decision making in social situations. Participants were also told that
we would collect pulse (heart rate) information at designated times during the
study using a simple pulse monitor that was connected to the laptop computer.

*** Validity Check of the Visualization

Our study aims to understand the effect of "elevated," as
compared to "normal," heartrate. As such, we needed to
show participants a visualization that afforded only a
relative value for heartrate, not an exact figure (since
different people may have different ideas of what number
value constitutes a normal or elevated heartrate).

We designed a visualization to display a relative heartrate (Figure [[fig:hr-viz]]) and
performed a small (n=25) face validity check to ensure that our visualization
would work as intended in the actual experiment. In our short validity survey,
we included three versions of the visualization, representing a mix of elevated,
low and normal heartrate, and two Likertscale questions: “The precise meaning of
this graphic is ambiguous,” and “I can interpret the difference between ‘low’,
‘normal’, and ‘high’ heartrate from this graphic,” which participants answered
from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” on a 5-point scale. We also
included two open-ended questions, “Please explain what the picture is telling
you about one's heartrate,” and “Please explain what this picture does not tell
you about one's heartrate.”

We distributed this survey over an email list to students and alumni of a
public, West Coast US university, and received 25 valid responses. The answers
to both Likert questions indicated agreement that the visualization was both
ambiguous (mean = 3.58, S.D. = 1.28) and also easily interpretable (mean = 3.41,
S.D. = 1.35). Importantly, openended qualitative responses confirmed that the
heartrate was easily understandable, but that the precise value of heartrate was
ambiguous.

*** Quantitative results

#+NAME: fig:cscw-study1
#+CAPTION: Means of entrustment and cooperation (left) and mood attributions (right) in elevated and normal heartrate conditions.
[[./figures/cscw-Study1.png]]

Our first hypothesis predicts that, when individuals believe that their partner
has a consistently elevated heartrate, compared to a normal heartrate, they will
rate the partner more negatively on mood attributes. Consistent with prior
research, we found an overall strong, statistically significant effect and
medium practical association between attributions and experimental condition,
F(4, 51) = 6.7, p < .0001; Wilk’s lambda = .66, partial eta squared =.34.
Turning to the individual outcomes, we find that perceptions of the partners'
anxiety is significantly higher in the EH condition (M = 3.86, SD = 1.72)
compared to the NH condition (M = 2.14, SD = 1.27), F(1, 54) = 18, p < .001;
partial eta squared = .25. Furthermore, participants rated their partners as
significantly more calm in the NH condition (M = 5.9, SD = 1.3) compared to the
EH condition (M = 4.29, SD = 1.46), F(1, 54) = 18.71 p < .001; partial eta
squared =.26. On the other hand, we found no statistically significant
differences for perception that the partner is “easily upset” or that the
partner is “emotional” (p = n.s.). In sum, we find strong statistical and
practical differences in perceptions of both anxiety and calmness, but no
statistical or practical differences in perceptions of how emotional or easily
upset the partner is in the two experimental conditions. Given the significant
omnibus test and significant results on two of the four individual outcomes,
Hypothesis 1 is partially supported.

Our second set of hypotheses predict that participants in the elevated heartrate
(EH) condition will exhibit lower trusting (H2a) and/or cooperative (H2b)
behavior compared to those in the normal heartrate (NH) condition. The average
points entrusted by participants in the EH condition (M = 7.88, SD = 2.18) was
not significantly different than the NH condition (M = 7.7, SD = 2.18), t =.28,
p=n.s, one-tailed test. Thus, individuals entrusted points to their partners at
approximately the same level in both conditions (Figure [[fig:cscw-study1]]). Hypothesis 2a is not
supported.

However, we found that the average cooperation rate in the EH condition (M =
.74, SD = .37) was statistically significantly lower than the NH condition (M =
.89, SD = .25), t = 1.76, p < .05, one-tailed test. Importantly, this result
shows a medium practical effect size (Cohen’s d = .47), indicating a meaningful
real world difference. On average, those in the normal heartrate condition
cooperated 20% more than those in the elevated heartrate condition (Figure [[fig:cscw-study1]]).
Hypothesis 2b is supported.

# Manipulation Checks

Since we designed the simulated actors in both conditions with trusting and
always-cooperative behavior, we did not expect participants to rate the
simulated actors differently in terms of the focal behaviors of cooperativeness
and trustworthiness between experimental conditions. This is a critical
manipulation check, since we need to rule out any perceived effect of the
simulated partners' behavior in order to establish that the primary treatment
(heartrate of partner) had an effect on the human participants' behavior. The
omnibus test of difference in perceptions of the trustworthiness and cooperative
behavior between conditions was not significant, F(2, 53) = .21, p = n.s.;
Wilk’s lambda = .99, partial eta squared =.01. Thus, as we would expect,
individuals did not indicate significant behavioral differences for the
trusting, cooperative simulated actor (which was programmed to behave exactly
the same in both conditions).

*** Qualitative results

At the end of our questionnaire, before the demographic questions and the
debriefing, participants were presented with two open-ended questions. The first
asked participants to “Tell us how you would describe your partner.” The second
asked participants “What, if anything, did heartrate tell you about your partner
during this experiment?” This section discusses and unpacks some of the
responses that these questions elicited.
# Elevated Heartrate

Many people who referred to elevated heartrate in their responses mentioned that
it signaled anxiety. In some cases, participants even reflected on a negative
relationship between elevated heartrate, anxiety and trust:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
how excited he/she is, whether he/she cheated

It was elevated all the time so I think s/he was anxious [...]
so I guess s/he did not completely trust me
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes further support our first hypothesis, as well as
findings of past work showing that elevated heartrate
typically signals anxiety and mood. In other words, elevated
heartrate (and heartrate in general) seemed to be about the
partner's current disposition, rather than who the partner
was as a person. While the majority of those who mentioned
elevated heartrate implied a causal relationship between the
signal and the game context, a few did not:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My partner's heart rate was elevated the whole time, most
students are stressed so that might be why.

They may have been nervous because of doing the
experiment itself.
#+END_QUOTE

The relative rarity of skepticism about the relationship
between heartrate and specific game events highlights the
crucial role of framing and salience in turning what might
be a disembodied signal (heartrate data) into a relevant,
contextual clue. We also noted diversity in beliefs about the
meaning of heartrate itself. Where almost all participants
who mentioned heartrate associated it with anxiety, at least
one participant had an entirely different take on his/her
partner's consistently elevated heartrate:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My partner's heart rate does not change too much which
indicates that he or she is very nice.
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes highlight overall diversity in what an elevated
heartrate is capable of meaning. Even within our relatively
small, and relatively homogenous sample of university
students, our quotes imply a mostly negative association
with elevated heartrate, but also a potentially long tail of
diverse beliefs about elevated heartrate.

# Normal Heartrate

Many participants said that normal heartrate indicated that
the partner was "calm," "chilled out," or "not anxious."
[HR signaled] that my partner was always calm. The heart
rate never fluctuated, it didn't make a difference.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
They remained calm

I think it showed that my partner wasn't too nervous to see
if he/she was returned the points or not, maybe because it
was just an experiment or maybe because he/she wasn't
worried about what result he/she was about to see was. 
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes show subjects inferring a direct connection
between the heartrate signal and the attribution of a calm
mood. One participant specifically mentioned that
consistency of normal heartrate made their partner seem
more trustworthy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My partner's heart rate has been consistently normal
throughout the experiment, so I guess s/he has no intention
to cheat.
#+END_QUOTE

Another participant, presumably a cooperative one, thought
that their partner’s heartrate would have risen if s/he had not
cooperated:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think it remained the same [normal] because I paralleled
my partner's actions whereas if I had contradicted them,
their heartrate probably would have changed in response.
#+END_QUOTE

In all of the above quotes (and the vast majority of
responses), participants inferred a relationship between
normal heartrate and calmness. However, a few participants
did not infer any relationships between behavior, moods
and the signal they saw.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Heartrate did not tell me anything. My partner was average
each time. I also am sure I have an elevated heart rate due
to coffee consumption so I did not take my partners into
consideration.

I based my decisions on their previous actions.
#+END_QUOTE

Not every participant explicitly inferred a calm mood from
the normal heartrate signal, but most did. Taken alongside
our quantitative results, our qualitative results provide
evidence that subjects have used the emotional attributions
they made based on their partner’s normal heartrate to guide
their behavior in the trust game.

** Sharing an unknown signal in a risky, uncertain interaction

In the prior experiment, we found that participants cooperate less with partners
who have elevated heartrates in the repeated trust game, compared to those with
normal heartrates. While this result supports one of our key hypotheses, it also
begs another question: Is the effect we observe due to heartrate specifically,
or might any elevated biosignal show the same results for negative perceptions
of mood and reduced cooperative behavior towards the partner?

In our second experiment, we attempt to tease out the effect of the heartrate
signal itself, compared to any “elevated” (versus “normal”) signal collected
from the body. We replicate the first study, except that we tell participants
that our monitor device measures SRI (Skin Reflectivity Index). SRI is an
unfamiliar biosignal, for which individuals should not have any prior cultural
or social beliefs.

*** Hypotheses

Without any context for what SRI means as a signal,
participants may assume that any biological signal that is
“elevated” from normal will be negatively associated with
one’s mood. If this is the case, then we should observe the
same general pattern of negative mood attributions and less
cooperative behavior when the partner has an elevated SRI
as we observed with heartrate.

On the other hand, perhaps heartrate is special due to its
common social associations with mood, anxiety, and even
deception. If heartrate is distinctive in this regard, then we
would not observe the same significant differences between
normal and elevated SRI and mood attributes, trust, and
cooperation rates with the partner.

To test the effect of our unfamiliar biosignal on behavior in
risky, uncertain interactions, we evaluate the exact same
hypotheses from study 1 again in the context of SRI:
H3. Participants who see a consistently elevated SRI from
their partner will rate their partner more negatively on
mood attributes, compared to participants who see a
consistently normal SRI in uncertain and risky social
interactions.

H4. Participants who see an elevated SRI will have lower
(a) trust rates (b) cooperation rates in uncertain and risky
social interactions compared to participants who see a
normal SRI.

*** Experimental Design and Methods

The second study was identical to the heartrate study in
every way, except that we told participants we were
measuring "Skin Reflectivity Index," instead of heartrate.
All mentions of the word "heartrate" in our original
experiment software were replaced with "SRI" and/or "Skin
Reflectivity Index”. We purposely did not define or explain
what the SRI signal is, or what its measurements mean. All
participants were debriefed on the true nature of the
experiment at the conclusion of the study. This debriefing
included the fact that the partner was based on idealized
behavior, and “SRI” was actually just a term for heartrate,
as collected by a standard light-based pulse sensor. As with
the first study, participants had the ability to ask the
experimenter questions at the end of the study, or send an
email if they had additional questions or concerns. We did
not receive any follow-up concerns from participants.
The only other variation from the first experiment is that, in
the SRI experiment, we told participants to place their
palms an inch above the light sensor rather than to place
their fingers on the monitor. Since placing a finger on a light
sensor is a familiar of measuring heartrate, this was done to
reduce the possibility that participants would think that SRI
is actually heartrate.

*** Participants

We recruited our sample for the second study from the same
population and using the same method as described in study
1. Our recruitment procedures ensured that no one who
participated in the first study could be recruited for the
second study. Sixty-three participants (63) completed the
second experiment, 40 women, 22 men, and one selfidentified
as ‘other’. The mean age of participants was 21.
Importantly, the gender distribution and age of the sample
was equivalent to the first study.

H3 predicts that when individuals believe that their partner has a consistently
elevated SRI, compared to a normal SRI, they will rate the partner more
negatively on mood attributes. As with the first study on heartrate, we found an
overall strong, statistically significant effect and medium practical
association between attributions and experimental condition, F(4, 59) = 4, p <
.01; Wilk’s lambda = .79, partial eta squared =.21. For the individual outcomes,
we find that perceptions of the partners' anxiety is significantly higher in the
elevated SRI condition (M = 3.97, SD = 1.62) compared to the normal SRI
condition (M = 2.67, SD = 1.24), F(1, 62) = 12.8, p < .001; partial eta squared
= .17. Furthermore, participants rated their partners as significantly more calm
in the normal SRI condition (M = 5.5, SD = 1.3) compared to the elevated SRI
condition (M = 4.68, SD = 1.63), F(1, 62) = 4.4 p < .05; partial eta squared =.07. Just as with the
heartrate study, we found no statistically significant differences for
perception that the partner is ‘easily upset’ or that the partner is ‘emotional’
(p = n.s.). In sum, we find strong statistical and practical differences in
perceptions of both anxiety and calmness, but no statistical or practical
differences in how emotional or easily upset one perceives the partner to be in
SRI conditions. Given the significant omnibus test and significant results on
two of the 4 individual outcomes, Hypothesis 3 is partially supported.

Our final hypotheses predict that participants in the elevated SRI condition
will exhibit lower trusting (H4a) and cooperative (H4b) behavior compared to
those in the normal SRI condition. The average points entrusted by participants
in the elevated SRI condition (M = 8.5, SD = 1.27) was not significantly
different than the normal SRI condition (M = 8.7, SD = 1.77), t =.39, p = n.s,
one-tailed test. Thus, individuals entrusted points to their partners at
approximately the same level in both conditions (Figure [[fig:cscw-study2]]). Unlike the heartrate
study, however, we found no significant difference in cooperation rate between
in the elevated SRI (M = .89, SD = .21) and the normal SRI condition (M = .88,
SD = .25), t = .09, p = n.s., one-tailed test. H4a and H4b are not supported.

# Manipulation Checks

As with the first study, the simulated actors in study 2 were programmed to be
consistently trusting and cooperative in the elevated and normal SRI conditions.
Thus, we do not expect participants to rate the simulated actors differently in
terms cooperativeness and trustworthiness between experimental conditions. As
expected, the omnibus test of difference in perceptions of the trustworthiness
and cooperative behavior between conditions was not significant, F(2, 61) = 3, p
= n.s.; Wilk’s lambda = .91, partial eta squared =.09.

*** Qualitative results

As in the heartrate condition, participants in the SRI condition were asked
open-ended questions at the end of the post-experiment questionnaire, before the
demographic questions and debrief. As in the heartrate condition, participants
were asked how they would describe their partner. However, unlike in the
heartrate condition, participants were asked, "Recall what we were measuring
with the sensor. Please describe it below." After completing this question,
participants proceeded were given two more open-ended items: "What, if anything,
did SRI (skin reflectivity) tell you about your partner during this experiment?"
and, "As a signal, what do you believe that SRI says about another person?"

*** The Meaning of an Unfamiliar Biosignal

We purposely did not explain what SRI might mean in this study. Nevertheless,
when asked what was being measured in SRI, some participants gave us thorough
explanations: The "reflectivity" part of SRI leads me to believe that the device
is measuring how much light is reflected by a person's palms, which leads me to
assume that SRI is increased when a person's hands are sweatier, and thus more
covered in water, which reflects light better than simply someone's skin.

While explanations like this one indicate that participants believed our signal
was real, reports of what participants thought SRI meant in the context of the
game are more relevant to our analysis here. Like in the elevated heartrate
conditions, and elevated SRIs were associated with either nervousness or
excitement.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the SRI reads high, it may indicate that the person expects to be betrayed in
some way or is hopeful of a positive result. I forgot what SRI stands for again.
Since his/her SRI is always elevated, I would assume he/she is nervous/excited
or just it's hot in here.

SRI may give insight as to how nervous or excited someone's response is to
something that happens. Maybe someone with a larger range in SRI is more
emotional. 
#+END_QUOTE


These assessments of SRI are quite similar to interpretations from
the elevated heartrate, and corroborate our quantitative findings that those who
saw elevated SRI rate their partners as more nervous. However, the fact that
these emotional assessments were similar in both elevated heartrate and elevated
SRI conditions, but behavioral outcomes were different, challenges our notion
that negative emotional cues caused these behavioral outcomes—a point we address
in more detail in the discussion below. As in the heartrate conditions, some
participants responded that SRI told them little or nothing of interest about
their partner: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Nothing at all about the person other than an arbitrary value of
a sensor.


Since the SRI seemed to be bouncing around in the blue
range but never got into the red range (which I assume
would be "abnormal" since the blue range was normal) I
don't think SRI is an accurate measurement of much.
As with heartrate, people cannot always be convinced that
a biosignal is informative, even after many rounds of
conditioning and a highly suggestive context. However, as
in the heartrate condition, responses indicating that SRI had
no meaning were a clear minority in our sample.
#+END_QUOTE


*** Elevated SRI

To help explain why elevated heartrate had a chilling effect on cooperative
behavior, where elevated SRI did not, we delve into the responses of
participants in the elevated SRI condition. When asked what SRI told them about
their partner, participants often reported nervousness or anxiety, just as we
noted in the quantitative results:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[SRI shows] stress or heightened anxiety

how reactive they are, or how close to the surface their
emotions are.

The nervousness of a person.
#+END_QUOTE

However, we noted that a significant number of participants
in this condition mentioned that elevated SRI had some sort
of positive association with behavior—even though it is also
interpreted as indicating anxiety.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Elevated means they feel safe and trustful. Lower than
average means they are defensive and scared.
#+END_QUOTE

This interpretation stands in stark contrast to elevated
heartrate, which also signaled anxiety, but had a negative
association with behavior. In explaining why participants
found elevated SRI to signal cooperativeness and trust, we
look toward the responses of participants who seemed to
learn a meaning for this signal:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Well, since their SRI was always high and they always gave
the money back to me, (based on these only two bits of info
I know) I assume the two are correlated and an elevated SRI
means that they're going to give the money back. [...] I guess
it means that they're trustworthy and will do the right thing
by their partner.

I cannot tell [what SRI means], but my partner's was
extremely elevated for the whole experiment and s/he was
good at conducting mutually beneficial transactions.
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes strongly suggest that, unlike for heartrate, SRI
participants picked up on a pattern between their partner's
always-cooperative behavior and the elevated biosignal that
we displayed to them, thus filling in the gaps about what
SRI meant in this context. In contrast, we found no evidence
that elevated heartrate participants learned such an
association in the first study, despite the fact that every
participant interacted with a perfectly cooperative partner in
all conditions and studies.

*** Normal SRI

As with those in the elevated SRI condition, many participants in the normal SRI
condition identified some relationship between SRI and the other person’s mood.
I think this helps identify how people are feeling internally when making
decisions.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
his/her mood at that point of time

[SRI shows] stress or heightened anxiety

how anxious they are.

I think our anxiety is being measured.

How anxious/nervous someone is, if their SRI is high
#+END_QUOTE

In some cases, participants in the normal SRI condition inferred that elevated
SRI might have a negative meaning: not to sure, high sri may indicate panic/fear
or anger low sri may indicate calmness and contentness. A person is less likely
to trust other people if he or she has a high SRI.

Overall, the responses for both SRI conditions support the interpretation that
participants learned an association between cooperative, trustworthy behavior
from the partner and SRI. As we argue in the following discussion, such
associations are more likely in the SRI conditions because, unlike for
heartrate, participants should have no preexisting beliefs or associations with
SRI.


*** Limitations

Controlled, laboratory studies always come with clear advantages (such as high
internal validity) and disadvantages (such as reduced external and ecological
validity). Our study did not attempt to emulate a real-world interaction context
with a biometric sharing device, though this is a clear next step, now that we
know there are important differences in how biosignals are interpreted.
Furthermore, our use of highly cooperative, computercontrolled interaction
partners with stable biosignals (always high or always normal), prevents us from
being able to speak to the effects of more dynamic behaviors and/or changes in
biosignals over longer periods of time. From these experiments, we also do not
know how these results will transfer to other contexts, and other types of
social interactions. Also, our study by nature focused on first-time, iterated
interactions, both with an interface and with another unknown person. We do not
know how these results might apply over the course of more personal
relationships, or after repeated experiences with a specific interface in a
biosignal sharing device. In addition, this research was conducted on young
adults at a large public university, which is an important limitation when
considering whether these results would hold across age groups and other key
sources of sociodemographic variation in the larger population.

** Discussion

We found that both heartrate and SRI signaled negative mood to participants,
including anxiety and lack of calmness. It is possible that almost any
“elevated” biosignals could be associated with negative mood attributions such
as anxiety and lack of calmness: many elevated signals (pulse, temperature,
blood pressure) carry associations with being angry, sick, hot-headed, and a
host of other negative attributions. People may default to such attributions
when seeing an unknown signal that comes from the body.

Elevated heartrate had a chilling effect on cooperation, where an unfamiliar
biosignal, SRI, did not. So, why did the negative mood attributions in the
elevated SRI condition not translate into reduced cooperation, as they did for
elevated heartrate?

Our results shed light on two relevant phenomena that may address this question.
First, pre-existing beliefs about heartrate are powerful: even when playing with
a very cooperative, trusting game partner, negative connotations surrounding
elevated heartrate appear to lead individuals to cooperate less. Our results
suggest that participants bring to uncertain social interactions their own
expectations about what elevated heartrate means, and that these biases cannot
be quickly overridden, even when behavioral evidence sends a positive message
(e.g., high cooperation and trust from the partner).

Second, we find evidence that participants can “learn” a social meaning for a
previously unknown signal. Our qualitative data suggest that participants in the
SRI condition associated whichever signal they saw (elevated or normal) with
cooperativeness, and trustworthiness. Unlike with heartrate, people did not have
preconceived notions of how SRI should affect the social behavior of the
partner, since SRI does not exist. Instead, we observe participants discovering
"what SRI means" by watching their partner's behavior in relation to the
biosignal. In the absence of guidelines for interpreting what SRI is or what it
measures, individuals appear to fill in the gaps with available behavioral
information.

If people can learn social meanings for previously unknown signals, perhaps even
pre-existing connotations for familiar biosignals could change over time. After
all, the meanings of a signal like heartrate are the product of associations
that have been shared and developed over centuries. However, technology allows
for new expressions of these ancient signals cite:Slovak2012.
If social heartrate
information became an easily accessible biosignal in trust-based interactions
like negotiations, we might find its social meaning could evolve further.
Unfortunately, short-term laboratory studies such as this one are unlikely to
trigger or detect enduring shifts in the social meanings of familiar biosignals.
We need both longer-term experiments, and mixed-methods research that can draw
from rich qualitative data as well as statistically and practically significant
changes in interpretations over time.

Broadly, our results raise questions about how and why unfamiliar signals take
on social meanings in different contexts of interaction. Researchers in CSCW and
HCI have long noted our tendency to read into cues and signals in
technology-mediated communications. From impact factors and citation counts in
scholarly work cite:Elsden2016a to societal indices cite:Wilson2003 , to health
metrics such as the bodymass index (BMI) cite:Campos2004, human have a tendency
to impart “real” meanings onto metrics, scales and signals – meanings that may
not align with the concepts their designers aimed to measure. It is critical
that we continue to question how biosignal data could shape our interpersonal
interactions, and whether the outcomes will always translate into meaningful
social information.

** Implications for design

From research projects like the sociometer, which produce “social metrics”
cite:Wu2008,
to consumer devices like the Spire, which compute "calmness" or "focus"
quotients cite:SpireInc,
developers are throwing different biometric signals at people
faster than they can learn what the signals mean in context. In the absence of
strong cultural beliefs about the signal, people could produce correlative
assumptions similar to the ones we observed in our experiment. Designers should
take care to establish what the signals in the applications mean, or could mean.
Testing the limits of what people are willing, or able, to believe, and whether
these beliefs transfer between different contexts, could have wide-reaching
implications for those who design interactions with wearable biosensors.

On the other hand, many research and commercial projects use signals that people
might associate with commonly understood experiences (e.g. a racing heart, a
sweaty palm). Designers should strongly consider how these embodied experiences
might color the conclusions that users jump to, and bound what users are willing
to believe. 

We also hope that researchers will investigate settings in which biosignals vary
over longer time periods, perhaps with a more naturalistic technology probe
study. Such a study could help us understand how prior beliefs about signals
both affect and are affected by social interactions in the course of everyday
life.

In general, wearable sensors can enable social interactions in which we share
more information than is normally possible face-to-face. The ability to surface
signals that are normally socially invisible (e.g. heartrate, or galvanic skin
response) presents new territory for designers of computermediated interactions.
While recent work has explored how these novel signals fit into our existing
understanding of social cues cite:Howell2016, much work remains. 

** Conclusion

We find that sharing heartrate can negatively influence trusting attitudes and
behaviors. However, heartrate alone does not communicate trust. Instead,
individual’s social expectations interact with the heartrate data to produce
context-specific meanings. Complicating matters further, our qualitative data
reveal a diversity of interpretations regarding the relevance and meaning of a
heartrate in context, and the privacy implications of biosensing technologies.
Our findings advance and complicate our understanding of the role that biosignal
sharing can play in social, computer-mediated contexts, and motivate more
detailed study into the mechanisms by which social interpretations arise from
basic physiological signals.

Further, our experimental results imply that interfaces can “teach” the meaning of some
biosignals, where others carry strong, pre-existing connotations that even
repeated interactions cannot easily alter. In general, prior beliefs about the
body (drawn from culture, lived experience) seem to shape what a biosignal can
mean in a given context. However, in the absence of prior beliefs, there exists
an opportunity—and a potential danger—that designers of biosignal-sharing
systems can condition participants to learn (potentially arbitrary) associations
between biosignals and social behaviors.

Aside from heartrate, we do not know what many other biosignals might be
associated with moods and behaviors. Other biosignals (e.g., galvanic skin
response, electroencephalography or EEG), could offer different affordances for
sense-making. It is unclear from our work how the social interpretation of the
signals from these devices could affect social behaviors such as dyadic and
group trust. Similar studies with signals from, e.g., the brain cite:Ali2014a
are a clear direction for future work. Especially interesting cases are signals
for which precise or empirical meanings are still being hotly debated, such as
EEG (brainwaves), a sensing modality we begin to discuss in the next chapter.

* Shifting to the brain
<<toward-brains>>

While the prior chapter establishes that people build mind-related meanings
around biosensory data, this chapter locates brainscanning as a fruitful case
for understanding how particular sensing technologies construct notions of mind.
I report on the qualitative and quantitative results of survey among
participants in a large (n>10,000), longitudinal health study, and an Amazon
Mechanical Turk population.

What can machines know about the mind, even theoretically? In this study, we
posed this question to 200 people, half of whom came from Mechanical Turk, and
half from a longitudinal study in which subjects contribute sensor data to track
health outcomes. We were interested in how people perceived risks around the
disclosure of sensor data, and how their expectations related to both the type
of device in question, and the participants' prior experience with disclosing
data from wearable devices.

Through a quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey data, we find some
differences in perceptions of risk between populations. However, we find that
certain devices draw greater notions of risk of mind-reading than others. In
particular, electroencephelography (EEG) appears to carry an unusually high
perceived risk, beyond even fMRI, which has proven more revealing in past
studies cite:Kay2008. We discuss implications for the design in EEG-based
brain-computer interface, a modality rapidly gaining in popularity in the
technology industry cite:Levy2017,Neurable2017,Metz2017, and for wearable
technologies generally.

** Prior work

In their qualitative study of activity trackers, Rader and Slaker (2017) found
that the ``visibility'' of tracking devices (how data are measured, and what
data are calculated as a result) has a large impact on the way people understand
these devices as working, and may impact the privacy decisions users make as a
result cite:Rader2017. While this study looked at a broad array of sensors, it
did not study particular threats to privacy. Meanwhile, past work in CSCW and
beyond has demonstrated that people build meanings around shared data from
wearable sensors pertaining to mood, emotions, and other aspects of mind
cite:Merrill2017. These studies raise the notion of the mind as a site for
exploring perceptions of sensor data, and what these data might mean. However,
the interpretations surfaced by previous studies are typically contextual,
specific to particular social contexts cite:Tolmie2016, and to particular types
of sensors. However, it is not clear from these studies how different sensors
compare to one another in the way users assess the risks of data disclosure.

In this work, we aim to study a specific privacy threat (knowing what a person
is thinking and feeling) across a variety of sensors. Through quantitative and
qualitative data, we aim to perform inductive work around two preliminary
questions: (1) Which sensing devices seem the most (and least) likely to reveal
what a person is thinking and feeling? (2) How do these perceptions change
according to this person's observed willingness to share sensor data with
others? In the following section, we outline how we examined these questions
using a survey, deployed across two distinct populations.

** Methods 
Our survey consisted of a question in which subjects ranked various sensors in
order of how likely they believed it was for data from those sensors to ``reveal
what a person is thinking and feeling.'' Our selection of sensors (Table
[[tab:sensors]]). aimed to include both sensors commonly found in wearable and
mobile devices, and sensors more commonly associated with the medical industry.
We sought to achieve a mix of modalities found only in medical devices, found
only in commercial devices, and found in both commercial and medical devices.

To capture a population willing to share sensor data, we submitted our survey to
participants in Health-e-Heart, a large (n > 40,000) longitudinal study in which
subjects volunteer to share data from wearable sensors longitudinally so that
researchers may monitor health outcomes cite:Estrin2010a. To compare this
population to a more general population, we also submitted our survey to
Mechanical Turk workers in the United States. Our survey included 100
Health-e-Heart participants and 100 participants from Mechanical Turk.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :float multicolumn
#+NAME: fig:sensor-rank
#+caption: ``Please rank the following sensors in how likely you believe they are to reveal what a person is thinking and feeling.'' Higher bars indicate higher rank, or higher likelihood of being revealing.
[[./figures/rankings.png]]

In our rankings, brainwaves (EEG) are seen as among the most revealing
biosignals, just below body language and facial expression, in their capacity to
reveal the inner workings of a person's mind. More common sensors such as GPS
and step count are seen as less revealing (despite empirical evidence suggesting
such data can be quite revealing indeed cite:Canzian2015). Mechanical Turk
participants thought virtual reality headsets and step counters were
significantly more likely to reveal what a person is thinking and feeling than
did Health-e-Heart subjects. On the other side, Health-e-Heart subjects believed
fMRI, blood pressure, blood oxygenation, and GPS/accelorometer were
significantly more revealing than did Mechanical Turk participants.
# _systematic differences between MTruk and HeH, e.g. MTurk always lower or something? Are these diffs even meaningful in ranking study?_.  

*** Qualitative results

When we asked subjects to reflect on why they answered the way they did during
the ranking task (Figure \ref{fig:rank}), EEG solicited the strongest and most
diverse reactions. Since this sensing modality is still relatively obscure in
consumer devices, we delved more deeply into qualitative data in hopes of
explaining these concerns. Subjects in both groups generally believed EEG to
reveal various details about the mind, mood, emotions, and identity. In the
Health-e-Heart group, several subjects gave relatively specific explanations as
to why they ranked this sensing modality highly.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S24) I assume some information can be gleaned from brain wave activity in various parts of the brain related to rewards or executive control, but without accompanying information, it may be difficult to discover my thoughts./

/(S23) EEGs note parts of the brain that are active. Again, in conjunction with other measurements, I suspect that some sense of what one is thinking and feeling could be learned./

/(S91) I would rate this relatively high on the list because science has shown that we can detect a lot about which areas of the brain are accessed and at which times. This can tell a person a lot about what they might be thinking and especially how they are feeling./
#+END_QUOTE

#  bit moe after 1st sentence
While these explanations range somewhat in their specificity and confidence,
they share the general sentiment that EEGs can be revealing. 
Subjects in the Mechanical Turk condition broadly shared this belief, though
tended to use less physiological detail in their explanations.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S157) Brain activity can pinpoint exact emotions by monitoring certain areas
on the brain./

/(S130) Brainwaves could tell you a lot more about what someone is thinking and
feeling. You could measure the patterns of brainwaves in an experiment./
#+END_QUOTE

# Unpack these quotes a bit
Meanwhile, some subjects from both groups did not
fit this trend. Ten subjects ranked EEG low in its ability to measure what a
person is thinking or feeling. Their qualitative answers revealed a diverse set
of reasons for this ranking. Three subjects indicated a general lack of faith in
brainwaves' reliability.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S20) I don't think we have the ability to translate brainwaves into thoughts
or emotions./

/(S101) EEG is very nonspecific and rarely can tell details reliably./

/(S138) Possible but not accurate./
#+END_QUOTE

These explanations broadly centered around EEG as a signal. They range somewhat
in their confidence, from a fundamental skepticism (S20) to caveats about
possible accuracy or specificity (S101, S138). In contrast to these three
subjects, S10 ranked EEG low because s/he felt the premise of a consumer grade
EEG was implausible.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S10) I assume that scientists can identify by brain patterns what others are feeling and thinking based off of years of research. I've never heard of a consumer grade eeg - and doubt it could be as powerful as a laboratory eeg. If it is then I would be interested in this product./
#+END_QUOTE

# Summarize a bit more after 1st sentence
This subject's explanation surfaces the practical differences in attitudes that
people might have to a technology's theoretical existence, and its realized
existence as a consumer device. Future work could look
more closely at how the presumed scientific authority of a brainscanning
apparatus affects people's willingness to accept specific BCI applications such
as passthoughts cite:Ali2014a. Finally, one subject's skepticism what brainwaves
can reveal stemmed from his/her personal medical experiences.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S116) My son has absence seizures, so his brainwaves change./
#+END_QUOTE

This particular quote highlights how individuals' life experiences might shape
the way they engage (or refuse to engage) with brain-sensing devices. In
general, this quote and others motivate the need for a rich, qualitative
understanding of people's first-hand experiences with brainscanning devices, as
well as data collection, in order to understand what role BCI applications such
as passthoughts could play in day-to-day life. 
# _Tie this in to the work we review in background_. _Transition to discussion_.

** Discussion

Our results find some differences between the Health-e-Heart and Mechanical Turk
groups, particularly around devices with medical associations. However, device
rankings were mostly the same between conditions. Our findings indicate that
sensing modalities play a large role in building understandings of what sensors
might reveal, along with prior experiences sharing sensor data. We discuss
implications for design in sensor-based interactions: different sensors may
trigger different concerns about privacy, concerns which may or may not match
empirical realities.

*** Differences between HeH and MTurk

Health-e-Heart participants believed fMRI, blood pressure, and blood oxygenation
to be more revealing than participants in the Mechanical Turk condition. Since
these subjects are participating in a medical study, it is possible that they
are more attuned to what medical devices can reveal, or simply that they are
primed to think about them. Health-e-Heart subjects also thought that GPS and
accelerometer were more revealing than their Mechanical Turk counterparts. This
differences indicates that their constant participation in monitoring does not
make them less sensitive to privacy concerns (i.e., they do not ``acquiesce'' to
such monitoring). Conversely, Mechanical Turk participants believed the VR
headset and step count were more revealing than did the Health-e-Heart subjects.
We found no significant difference in experience with virtual reality between
the two groups. Future work should examine possible causes for this difference.
As virtual reality grows in popularity, and as the producers of these devices
increasingly attempt to outfit VR headsets with sensors cite:Liptak2016, it will
be important to understand what about VR causes people concern.

*** The effect of sensing modalities

Our most surprising finding, consistent across both groups, was the overall high
ranking of EEG. EEG was perceived as more likely to reveal what a person is
thinking or feeling than fMRI, which prior work indicates to be a more detailed
brainscanning apparatus cite:Kay2008; EEG is course-grained in comparison. Future work
should examine more closely why EEG was so highly ranked (e.g., perhaps
participants did not know what fMRI is).
Reasons aside, EEG's high rank in our finding offers both opportunities and
challenges for designers. People's belief in EEG's ability to sense intimate
details may allow designers to create creative, helpful or therapeutic
applications cite:Interaxon. On the other hand, these same beliefs could allow
designers to trick users cite:Ali2014a, or might dissuade prospective users from
wearing EEG at all.
These questions are increasingly important as EEG-based BCI is gaining interest
in industry cite:Metz2017,Neurable2017 and in the public imagination
cite:Levy2017,Urban2017. How will people encounter these devices, and find their
data meaningful (or not) in the course of life? The answer to these questions
depends heavily on what users think their data can reveal. Thus, future work
should look longitudinally at EEG and BCIs as these devices ebb and flow in the
public (and corporate) imaginary.

*** Implications for design

# Nothing in our work suggests these folk theories are correct or incorrect,
Our studies reinforce past work in demonstrating the relevance of folk theories
in understanding what sensors can reveal cite:Rader2017. However, our work also
indicates that different sensing modalities may heighten particular privacy
concerns (e.g. EEG). By the same token, other devices may obfuscate privacy
concerns, creating a compromising position for users as they are lulled into a
false sense of security. For example, GPS and accelorometer have together been
used to detect mental health status cite:Canzian2015; the fact that these
sensors were not rated highly gestures toward differing concerns across sensing
modalities, and the fact that these concerns may not align with technical
efforts among designers and engineers. In general, future work should examine
more deeply how prior experience with devices meets with expectations about the
body to produce understandings of privacy, what devices can know. As emerging
devices (such as VR and EEG) become more familiar to users, future work should
monitor beliefs about sensing modalities as these technologies develop. Sensors
such as GPS and accelorometer are now ubiquitous, but attitudes around them have
likely changed since their introduction cite:Consolvo2005. Through longitudinal
studies, we stand a chance at observing changes in attitudes, thus putting us in
a position to anticipate changes in privacy attitudes and privacy-preserving
behaviors.

#   - VR (still new at the time of the survey) is seen as "just
#     an input device."
# - so privacy concerns are real, but not all devices may trigger them equally!
#   - future work should be mindful of peopels' differing opiniosn to diff sensor modalities
# - in the case of BCIs, EEG/brainscanning still exotic in HCI, and past work
#   would indicate this affects people's responses to it _[work]_; we find support
#   for this claim.
#   - future work keep an eye on ppl's beliefs about BCI as these technologies developp
# # - This study looked at very specific question 'what thinking and feeling' future
# #   work could branch out

** Conclusion

Our findings complicate recent work around the folk interpretations of sensor
data, indicating that prior experience with sensors is only one way to
understand where interpretations of sensor data come from. Beliefs about the
body play an equally important role in shaping beliefs about what sensors can
know. As industry pushes toward new sensing modalities such as EEG, future work
should remain critical in probing the beliefs of end-users, as their
apprehensions will shape the sorts of applications that users are willing to
accept.

* Talking to engineers about brain-computer interface
<<chi>>

This chapter shifts in focus from the users of sensing devices to their
engineers. Having motivated EEG as a case study for further exploration, this
chapter examines the beliefs of software engineers through their interactions
with a working brain-based authentication system. This population's beliefs are
particularly critical as consumer brainscanning devices have become open to
tinkering through software. Although we find a diverse set of beliefs among our
participants, we discover a shared understanding of the mind as a physical
entity that can and will be ``read'' by machines.

A slew of inexpensive brainscanning devices
underwrite such utopic visions.
2017 saw a BCI for virtual reality gaming cite:Neurable2017
and brainwave-sensing sunglasses cite:Optical2017
join the already large list of inexpensive,
consumer BCIs on the market cite:Levy2017,Interaxon,Grierson2011a.
These devices, 
which are
typically bundled with software development kits (SDKs),
shift the task of building BCIs 
from the realm of research
into the realm of software development.
But what will software developers /do/ with these devices?


# This paper's contribution
# MORGAN: - tease apart utopia/dystopia, what work are they down in silicon valley, in BCI research
# 10-12 participants is respectable
# reach saturation to where you can leave stuff out
# ppl from very diff background always interesting
# recruit someone who hasn't thought about it as much
This study employs a technology probe 
to surface narratives, and anxieties, around consumer BCIs
among professional software engineers.
We provided a working brain-computer interface
to eight software engineers from the San Francisco Bay Area.
As brainscanning devices become more accessible to software developers,
we look to these BCI ``outsiders'' 
as a group likely to participate in the future of brain-computer interface.
Specifically, we provided participants with a brain-based authenticator, 
an application predicated on the notion that a BCI
can detect individual aspects of a person,
making it a potentially fruitful window into broader beliefs 
about what BCIs can reveal cite:Rose2016a,Dumit2004. 

Despite heterogeneous beliefs about the exact nature of the mind,
the engineers in our study shared
a belief that the mind is physical,
and therefore amenable to sensing.
In fact, our participants all believed that the mind could and would 
be ``read'' or ``decoded'' by computers.
We contribute to an understanding of how engineers' beliefs
might foretell the future of brain-controlled interfaces.
If systems are to be built that read the mind in any sense,
we discuss how such systems may bear on the long-term future of privacy and cybersecurity.
# MORGAN - forget 'accurate/usable'  -  not a usability study
# NOURA - are you testing the usability of the authentication system? like, your design of the GUI that instructs them how to use the app and tells them if successful, etc? 
# or the tangible design of the system? sounds like probably not, although you probably want to make a case for why the design is reasonable enough that people didn't struggle to use it
# RICH - Are you really concerned about usability? It sounds like you're trying to look at other issues/values/concerns

*** Brain-computer interfaces & pathways to broader adoption

# what are BCIs? 
BCIs allow people to interact with computers without muscular action.
Instead, nervous system activity is translated to a discretized (digital) signal.
BCIs can be categorized broadly as invasive (requiring implantation)
or non-invasive (requiring only external, removable equipment).
Non-invasive, consumer BCIs, are lightweight, require minimal setup, and do not require special gels.
EEG (electroencephalography)
is currently the most viable choice of sensing modality for consumer BCIs cite:Carrino2012.

# BCIs, accessibility now, 
# but sometimes accessibility=>other stuff
# RICHMOND -  think this would be more storngly motivated if you put (or re-summarize) your points about past accessibility tech (like speech to text) broadening to general consumers AND some evidence that people want to envision BCIs as a general consumer device. Also that new people get involved with these. (E.g. lots of VR researchers today weren't VR researchers a decade ago, nor are they the same people who do VR PTSD/therapy research). Therefore, talking to experts who might try to do UX/HCI stuff with it in a few years as it becomes more available is a cool thing. 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design
# http://inclusivedesign.ca/
# - anne  has papers
# - morgan aimes  has papers on  city design
# what might this "other stuff" be? study sf bay to find out
Historically, researchers have conceived of BCIs as accessibility devices,
particularly for individuals with severe muscular disabilities.
However, accessibility devices can sometimes provide routes for early adoption, and thus broader use.
Speech-to-text, for example, was once a tool for individuals who could not type;
eventually, it became adopted as a tool for computer input, now
commonplace in IoT devices such as Alexa and Siri.
Since accessibility devices can give rise to broader consumer adoption,
we ask what such a pathway might look like for brain-computer interfaces.
With an expanding array of inexpensive brainscanning hardware,
many of which come bundled with engineer-friendly SDKs,
the pathway to a future of consumer BCI
increasingly becomes a matter of software engineering.

Thus, we look to software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area.
We use these engineers as a window into broader beliefs about ``Silicon Valley,''
a term we use here to stand in for 
the technical, economic and political
climate that surrounds the contemporary 
technology industry in the area cite:saxenian1996regional.
While we do not believe only Silicon Valley engineers
will influence the future of BCIs,
historically, these engineers have a outsized impact on the
types of technologies developed for mass consumption,
especially with respect to software.
As BCI hardware becomes more accessible,
and therefore more amenable to experimentation as software,
this group once again holds a unique role in
devising a consumer future for this biosensor.
Indeed, the Muse, and similar devices, have robust SDKs and active
developer communities that are building and showcasing BCI applications cite:NeurotechX.

However, we did not want our subjects to have first-hand experience
in developing BCIs, as we did not want them to be primed by existing devices' limitations. Instead,
we selected individuals who indicated they would be interested in experimenting with consumer BCI devices in their free time.
This screening was meant to draw subjects likely to buy consumer devices and develop software for them.
We believed that these engineers' professional expertise in software
development afford a desirable criticality around our technical artifact. 
# In
# other words, these software engineers provided a reasonable starting point in
# interrogating a future for consumer BCI.



# TODO they had no  prior exp. with BCIs..................but why?

# BECAUSE..................
# BCIs.......................basically fictional......
# try to understand how ppl in bay area 
#  understand this device today
#   MORGAN - fine, valid, with proper caveats. 
#   if point is to explore utopianism then you've got to. 
#   would be interesting to compare. industry insiders & people who know about the brain.

# RICHMOND- Maybe it's about thinking about BCIs as a future platform of technology (similar to VR).
*** What brain scans can tell

# IMPROVE TRANSITION 

Brain scanning holds a unique /charisma/ cite:Ames2015,
not only among researchers in related fields cite:Rose2016a,
but among non-experts as well cite:Ali2014a.
Ali et al (2014) found university undergraduates believed a brain scanning device 
(a fake one, unbeknownst to them)
could reveal intimate details of their thoughts,
even after receiving a lecture about the limitations of
brain scanning technologies cite:Ali2014a.
In that study, participants saw
scans of the /brain/
as informative with regard to the /mind/,
a distinct entity that is potentially more expansive than the brain cite:Clark2013,Hayles1999a.

This entanglement of mind and brain has been explored
by past work in science and technology studies.
For example, Dumit's (2004) study of positron emission tomography (PET)
explores
utopian (and dystopian) visions of diagnosing mental illness, or even criminality, 
from scans of a person's brain cite:Dumit2004.
The idea of the mind's ``legibility'' via computational technologies
has been concretely explored by Rose (2016) cite:Rose2016a,
who ties together a number of efforts across neuroscience and cognitive science
to argue that specific technical implementations from these fields
(along with their rhetoric around, and beliefs about the brain)
allow /the mind/ to be ``read'' or ``decoded.''

However, there exists an opportunity
to investigate how pervasive such beliefs are
among those who are not neuroscience experts, 
yet nonetheless technical practitioners.
Given the recent shift of brain scanning equipment from research tool
to consumer electronic device,
we ask what software engineers,
newly able to develop applications around brain scanning,
might build.
Answers to this question could have far-reaching consequences, 
from marketing, to entertainment, to surveillance.
In particular, we aim to center how engineers' ideas about the mind,
especially its relationship to the brain and body,
inform and constrain their beliefs about what BCIs can (and should) do.

*** A BCI technology probe
# study with tech probes + interviews

In this study, we use a technology probe to examine the beliefs of software engineers
about what BCIs can reveal about the mind.
Technology probes are functional apparati
intended to both collect data /in situ/ from participants, and to 
inspire participants to reflect on the probes, and on their beliefs more generally cite:Hutchinson2003.

Probes have a long and diverse history within HCI,
often referring to a variety of different practices cite:Boehner2007.
In the context of our study,
our probe seeks primarily to answer research questions,
rather than to figure as one step in an iterative design process.
Unlike some probes in past work
ours was not intended for longitudinal deployment.
Instead, we aimed to gather beliefs about particular technologies and domains
through a session of open-ended interaction with a device cite:Leahu2014.

Our probe's unfinished appearance was intended to
invite critique and playful experimentation cite:Devendorf2016a,Leahu2014.
However, unlike a mock-up or provocation,
our probe did function as advertised,
allowing participants to 
interact with the devices in an exploratory and unconstrained way
(indeed, many engineers tested that the device's feedback was real).
We designed our probe to steer participants away 
from providing narrow feedback about the interface at hand,
and toward sharing their broader beliefs about the brain and mind.

*** Brain-based authentication

Our study employs a brain-based authenticator as a research probe
to elicit engineers' beliefs about BCIs (and the mind and/or brain they purport to sense).
This section explains how brain-based authentication works,
and why we chose this application for our study.

# defining authentication
Authentication
(i.e., logging into devices and services)
entails a binary classification problem: 
given some token, the authenticator must decide whether or not the person is who they claim to be.
These tokens typically relate to one or more ``factors'': 
knowledge (something one knows, e.g. a password), 
inherence (something one is, such as a fingerprint),
or possession (something one has, such as a device) cite:Chuang2013b.
Brain-based authentication relies on signals generated from individual's brains to uniquely authenticate them,
which has a number of potential advantages over other authentication strategies (see cite:merrill2017future for a review).
First, brainwaves are more difficult to steal than biometrics fingerprints, which are externally visible,
and left in public as one's hands touch objects in the environment.
Brainwaves also change over time, making theft even less likely.
Second, brain-based authentication requires no external performance, making it impervious to ``shoulder-surfing attacks'' (e.g., watching someone enter their PIN). 

# Why authentication here?
We chose to build a
brain-based authenticator
for our study for a few reasons.
First, having participants use a functioning system helped them imagine how they might use BCIs themselves.
Second, the system is a plausible one, backed by peer reviewed research, thus we expected our participants to judge its claims credible.
Third, the system embeds particular assumptions about what brain scanners are able to capture.
Our system embeds ideas that our Muse headset can capture
aspects of individual brains that are unique;
as such, we expect that a working, brain-based authenticator will encourage participants to reflect 
not only on how a BCI applications might be adopted by the broader public,
but also on what BCIs may be able to reveal about the mind and brain,
and to critically examine the limits of what BCIs in general are able to do.

*** Implementation

# device
Since we wanted our technology probe to appear portable enough for use in the real world,
we decided to use a pre-existing consumer EEG device to build our authenticator.
We settled on the Interaxon Muse (Figure \ref{fig:usage}), a $299 headband that can be worn easily,
transmits data wirelessly, and requires no gel to maintain contact between the scalp and electrodes cite:Interaxon.
Using a system that required conductive gel
would have signaled to the participants that the technology is still limited to lab settings, 
and not yet ready for the real world, which could have influenced their responses.

Although the Muse’s signal likely contains noise, a perfectly clean
signal was not necessary to elicit beliefs from subjects in the context of our
technology probe.
Further, despite the Muse's small form-factor and dry electrodes,
past studies have verified its signal is sufficient quality for some neuroscientific research cite:Krigolson2017a.

Due to the device's battery life and intermittent connectivity when walking, the
Muse headband did made a longer-term study impractical. Thus, we opted to
perform a study over a short time and in a controlled environment, drawing on
past technology probe studies with similar constraints
cite:Devendorf2016a,Isbister2006.
# factors we could control in the hourlong setting. 
# are our findings about future pervasiveness limited by the short timescale of our deployment? 
# Past studies have used probes over a short duration [3] and in controlled settings [1,2,4] 
# to surface design considerations aimed at longer-term use.  

# collection / classification
# Specifically, we used the device's raw data as input to our classification system.
Data from the Muse was collected via the device's native OSC interface,
and stored in a timeseries database.
Queries from this database were used to provide training data for a machine learning classifier.
In a preprocessing step, we performed a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to generate frequency-domain data
from the time-domain data.
In the machine learning step, we split a corpus of readings (and labels) into train and validation groups. 
Using XGBoost cite:Chen2016, we trained a binary classifier on seven different splits of the train group.
After the classifier was produced, we validated its performance on the withheld validation set.
# maybe a little bit more clarity on "different splits of the train group," what XGBoost does during this step

# data that it classified
Given a target participant to classify,
our classifier used any reading from this participant as a positive example,
and any reading /not/ from this participant
as a negative example.
Negative examples also included signals with poor quality, and signals from which the device was off-head or disconnected.
Ideally, the resulting classifier should produce "authenticate" labels when the device is on the correct person's head, and "do not authenticate" labels at any other time.
This classifier could output its labels to a simple user interface (UI), described in the next section.
*** Interface

As the device produces data,
the classifier outputs labels of ``accept'' or ``reject.''
Our interface displays these labels as a square of 0s and 1s,
which filled up as data from the device rolled in (Figure \ref{fig:ui}).

Several considerations motivated this design.
First, the UI represents the probabilistic nature of the classification process.
Individual signals may be misclassified, but over blocks of time,
the classifier should be mostly correct (represented as blocks of mostly 0s by our interface).
Thus our simple UI makes visible both 
the underlying mechanism of binary classification,
and its probabilistic nature.
Second, because our UI provides potentially ambiguous feedback
(as opposed to unambiguous signals of "accept" or "reject"),
it allows for potentially richer meaning-making and explanatory work cite:Sengers2006a.
Toward this end, the UI's real-time reactivity
(``blocks'' of 1s and 0s filled in over time) 
allows participants to experiment actively with the device, 
forming and testing hypotheses as to what makes classification succeed or fail.
# feeling another here..."why is this impt?"

# TODO am I doing Boer et al (2012)'s "provotype", or a provocative prototype?????
Finally, our UI gives the probe an ``unfinished'' appearance.
We believed this interface would cause our participants to activate their ``professional vision'' as tech-workers cite:Goodwin1994,
and critique or test the device as if it were a design of their own.
Ideally, we hoped participants would intentionally stress-test the device,
or find playful ways of misusing it.
These misuses could allow participants to form hypotheses about why and how the device succeeds and fails.

** Methods

We recruited participants by word of mouth.
A recruitment email explained that subjects
would interact with a working BCI,
and be asked their opinions about the device, and about BCI broadly.
We screened respondents by their current occupation
and stated interest in experimenting with BCIs in their free time.
# TOOD let's see if i understand this motivation
#      after adding stuff to the related work / motivation section..

# JOHN <2017-09-12 Tue>
# do we mention to subjects this is something we study? effect of credibility?
# > for now I say nothing, err on side of anonymity. if it comes up, mention in rebuttal.

A total of eight people participated, three of which were women.
Participants' ages ranged from 23 to 36.
We met with subjects for a single, one-hour session
in which we trained and tested a brain-based authenticator,
allowing them to interact with it in an open-ended way.

These sessions were designed as a semi-structured interview,
interspersed with conversation between the researcher and the participant.
Our study protocol was approved by our institutional IRB.
Interviews were recorded, and later transcribed.
We performed an ``issue-focused'' analysis of the transcriptions cite:weiss1995learning,
allowing topics and themes to emerge during analysis.
Subjects names were changed to pseudonyms to protect their anonymity.
The remainder of this section describes in detail how subjects
interacted with the device during sessions.

*** Wearing the device

The interviewer began by explaining that participants would wear a BCI,
which we would train to work as an authenticator, answering participants' questions
about how the device would work.
Subjects were told that they would be asked about their opinions on BCIs generally,
and that their anonymized voice and EEG data would be collected.

The interviewer asked participants to place the EEG headband themselves,
and to assure that the device fits comfortably,
at which point
the interviewer would begin recording signals from the device.
Next, the interviewer would ask participants
how they felt about having the EEG device on their head.
This question would typically begin a short, open-ended exchange
about their past experience with brain-scanning devices,
and prior knowledge, if any, of BCIs.
This exchange would segue into a broader discussion about the participant's 
use and relationship with technology, in personal and work life.

After this initial conversation, the interviewer would perform a brief /calibration/ step with the participant,
in which data are collected to train a custom classifier for use in authentication.
Participants would perform a number of tasks, or /mental gestures/, 
prompted by a stimulus presentation program.
These tasks provide a more diverse corpus of an individual's signals,
which should enable a more robust (and accurate) classifier.
After this calibration procedure, which usually lasted about ten minutes,
the interviewer would perform a semi-structured interview with participants.
The interviewer would continue to record data from the Muse throughout this interview.
# maybe a little more clarity that the participant is just sitting there with a clicker in front of a laptop screen as instructions are displayed
# how many tasks, how long per task?

*** Using the authenticator

At this point, the interviewer would explain to participants that the data collected thus far
would be used to train an custom authenticator for them.
The interviewer would explain roughly how the authenticator would work:
the probe should /accept/ readings when the participant is wearing the device,
and /reject/ readings in any other case.

Next, the interviewer would run a script that trained our XGBoost classifier (Section [[Implementation]]).
Participants could watch the training process run, if interested (a few were).
After the training process completed, the researcher would set up the UI (Section [[Interface]])
and allow participants to view the classifier's output in real-time using live data from the participant's Muse device.
Participants would then see the probe's /accept/ or /reject/ classifications using the live data from their headset.

After allowing participants to acclimate to the output, and answering any preliminary questions,
the interviewer would encourage the participant to experiment with the authenticator, and share any impressions, reactions or ideas.
The open-endedness of this session was meant to encourage participants to explore the device's capabilities and limitations, free of particular tasks to accomplish.
However, we suspected that our participant population would be particularly prone to ``hypothesis-testing,'' exploring the devices limitations by building theories about how it might work.
We structured the session around this assumption, preparing to ask participants to think aloud as they explored the device's capabilities.

After some free-form exploration (usually involving some back-and-forth with the participant),
the interviewer would transition into a semi-structured interview, 
which would occur with the device still active.
The interviewer would ask participants to unpack their experience,
and lead them to explore what they felt the device could reveal about them.
After some discussion, the formal interview would conclude, and the participants would remove the Muse device from their head.
# In several cases, participants wished to continue conversations after the study ended.
# The interviewer and participant would move to an informal environment (a cafe or pub) and continue dialogue on study themes and topics. 
# These conversations were recorded with participants' consent.
# When all conversations concluded, the interviewer would explain to participants the research goals of the study.

** Experiencing the authenticator

# John <2017-08-22 Tue>
# we can collect from 8 participants, focus on some subset
# who can you point to, show analysis legit? 
#  > freaky

In general, we found particular reflections to come at
different points in the interview protocol.
Critiques (and questions) about the device narrowly tended to come
as soon as engineers placed the device on their heads.
Reflections on the BCI broadly, and its future trajectories, tended to come after
viewing the probe's feedback for some time.
As these conversations progressed, participants naturally 
tended to reflect on what future BCIs could do.
Subjects would typically
relate the capacities of the probe, and of possible future technologies,
to their ideas about the mind, body or brain.
The probe continued to run during these discussions.
Toward the end of the interview,
the researcher would prompt participants to reflect on any anxieties
they might have about the future of BCIs
(interestingly, only one participant raised this subject on their own).
The remainder of this section is organized to roughly mirror
this common order of participants' reflections during interviews.

*** Using the BCI probe
Our working authenticator elicited diverse reactions from the engineers in our study.
Almost all participants cracked jokes after putting on the headband
(three subjects commented that they felt like they were ``from Star Trek'').
All participants except Joanna said they would not wear the device in public,
though a few conceded that they might if the headsets were more common.
Terrance commented,
``If most people are doing it, then it's fine. 
Sort of like stock speculation.''

Perceptions of the authenticator's accuracy were mixed.
Four participants found that the authenticator worked well for them.
For these participants, the authenticator consistently rejected blocks when the headset was off of their head, 
or worn by the researcher.

On the other hand,
four participants found the probe consistently rejected every reading, whether it came from them or the researcher
(i.e., they experienced false rejections, but not false acceptances).
These subjects often tried to remedy the situation by attempting tasks they had rehearsed, typically with mixed success.
Most of these subjects concluded that there was not enough training data to produce reliable classification,
but that such a system would work with a larger corpus.
In contrast,
Alex, a 30 year-old founder of an indoor agriculture startup,
blamed himself, saying ``I must not produce very distinguishable thoughts.''

Those participants who felt the probe's authentication was reliable
tended to center their explanations on why it worked.
Participants who experienced less consistent accuracy with the authenticator
tended to center their explanations on how the device might be improved,
e.g. with better or more comprehensive sources of data.
This impulse to ``fix'' likely speaks to our participants' general tendency to engineer working systems,
which extended in our case even to this experimental technology.

# When getting acquainted with the authenticator,
# participants often took the device off to see if it (correctly) failed to authenticate them.
# Five of the eight participants asked the researcher to wear the device, to see if it failed.
# Many expressed some initial skepticism that the device really worked,
# indicating that the feedback might be false; several others were simply skeptical
# about the device's accuracy.
# This skepticism was encouraged by the interviewers,
# as we hoped it would provide a grounds for expressing
# their opinions about BCIs more generally.

As we hoped, the engineers engaged critically with the technical implementation of the probe.
In general, engineers asked about the machine learning infrastructure underlying the authenticator,
and several participants (particularly John, Mary and Alex) asked specific questions,
and made specific recommendations, diagnosing issues with the authenticator
by thinking about the diversity and size of the training set.
Almost all participants noted the authenticator worked better when 
they were not looking at the visual feedback from the user interface.
Participants generally theorized that this might occur because they were not viewing feedback when training the classifier.
In these cases, the engineers appeared to apply their domain knowledge 
to their observations in using our technology probe.

# Contrary to our expectations, the probe's feedback
# was rarely interpreted as being ambiguous. Participants
# tended to view the blocks as either unambiguous ``accepts'' or ``rejects.''
# It is unclear whether this lack of observed ambiguity 
# was a shortcoming of our interface,
# an effect of our probe's focus on authentication,
# or a quirk of our participants.

*** Reflecting on the future of BCI

# Our technology probe was designed to elicit broader beliefs about BCI, 
# and other topics that participants might find relevant or interesting.
Our technology probe
caused almost all of our participants to speculate on the future of BCIs generally.
To most participants, the future of BCIs seemed to be largely pre-determined.
One of our participants, Terrance (a 24 year-old software engineer at a small transportation startup), 
removed the headband to inspect it, and commented on its awkward visibility.
In doing so, he reflected on the future of BCIs, 
speaking in no uncertain terms about a future of computer-mediated ``telepathy.'' 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Things just get progressively smaller until they disappear. And one day this'll
just be an implant in my brain, doing crazy things. It'll be interesting
socially, how people come to terms with it, when it's just an implant, or at
least very pervasive ... I could send you a message, and it could be like you're
thinking it yourself, even if you're on the other side of the Bay. /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE

Terrance believed that BCI /will/ become more prevalent:
not just that smaller sensors will lead to more effective or usable BCIs,
but that they will also result in greater uptake of the technology.
While he references the social dimension of their adoption,
he indicates that people will need to ``come to terms with'' the developments,
rather than providing direct agency to users who may choose to adopt the technology or not.

Two participants felt less sure that such a future of pervasive BCI would ever come to pass.
Elizabeth, a 30 year-old front-end engineer, noted skepticism about signal quality, or usefulness 
outside of persons with disabilities.
Mary, a 27 year-old software engineer at a large company, pointed to social reasons for her skepticism. 
In reflecting on the relative accuracy of the probe's authentication performance during her session,
she commented that ``90 plus percent'' of people would be ``totally freaked out'' by brain-computer interfaces generally.
She continued to say that companies may themselves stop BCIs from becoming too pervasive or advanced.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I feel like those companies, even if this were feasible, there's a moral quandary they philosophically have not figured out. 
They will not let the research get that advanced ... I just don't imagine them being like, "okay computer, now read our brains." /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

While the probe was effective in spurring subjects to talk about
issues around BCIs, its accuracy as an authentication device
did not seem to alter participants' belief in BCI's future
as a widespread technology.
Unsurprisingly, the four subjects who experienced reliable authenticator accuracy
all expressed that BCIs would become commonplace in the future.
However, only Joanna connected the device's poor performance in her session
with a probability of ongoing accuracy issues for BCIs in the future.
The other three subjects who felt the device did not perform accurately
all offered explanations as to why, and explained
that future devices would fix these issues.

*** Mind, brain, body

# mind-as-computational-brain 
During their interactions with the probe,
almost all of our subjects discussed their
deeper beliefs about the nature of the mind, 
and its relationship to the brain and body.
Since participants discussed
the future trajectory of BCIs led to discussions
while the probe continued to work (or fail),
the subject often arose of what BCIs might be able to detect, even theoretically.
As one example, John, a 26 year-old software engineer at a small chat startup, 
noticed that the authenticator only worked when he was speaking, 
but not when he was listening to the researcher.
He offered an explanation for the discrepancy.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There's probably some kind of fundamental difference between creating thoughts
and consuming thoughts. You're still making thoughts, right, but it's almost
like programming versus being programmed. /(John)/
#+END_QUOTE

When pressed on how strictly he meant his metaphor of programming, John
confirmed that he meant it quite literally, saying, /``I think we are just
computers that are way more sophisticated than anything we understand right
now.''/ We return to this strictly computational account of the mind as ``just''
a computer in the discussion.

Mary gave a computational account of mind that was more metaphorical than
John's, drawing on comparisons between machine learning and the mind. She cited
the many ``hidden layers'' in deep neural networks, and that, like in the brain,
``information is largely distributed.'' While she believed deep learning models
and the brain were ``different systems foundationally,'' she said ``there are
patterns'' that relate the two to one another, and indicated that advances in
deep learning would spur a greater understanding of the brain.

Although six of our participants provided a largely computational account of
mind-as-brain, not all did. Joanna, a 31 year-old engineer who previously
completed a PhD in neuroscience, felt that the mind was ``the part of the brain
I am aware of, the part that is conscious.'' She believed that neurotransmitters
throughout the body have a causal relationship to what happens in the mind, but
do not constitute the mind themselves; the contents of mind occur physically in
the brain, and the brain alone. In other words, her account is one of ``mind as
conscious awareness,'' and while unconscious phenomena affect mind (e.g. the
body, environment), they are not part of the mind /per se/. Interestingly, the
probe did not work well for Joanna, and she felt confident that its poor
performance was due to contaminating signal from her body (a theory she tested,
and validated, by moving around and observing the probe's feedback).


Meanwhile, in one subject's account, the mind extended beyond the confines of
the body. Terrance felt that there was ``no meaningful difference'' between the
body and brain, nor between the body and the physical environment at large,
saying that ``you can't have one without the other.'' He believed that all three
of these entities constitute the mind in a mutually-dependent way. However,
Terrance indicated that the mind is still strictly physical, as are these three
entities. Although Terrance did not provide details on how exactly the mind
extended beyond the body, it is interesting to note this position's similarities
to Clark's (2013) account of the extended mind cite:Clark2013, or Edward
Hutchins's work on distributed cognition cite:Hutchins2005, though Terrance was
familiar with neither.

Participants also offered differing levels of confidence in their beliefs about
the nature of the mind. Joanna (who has a background in neuroscience) reported
that ``we do not know everything we need to know'' about how the mind works.
Three other subjects reported similar beliefs. However, those subjects with a
computational account of mind tended to feel more confident that their account
was substantially accurate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think the consensus is that the body is mostly like the I/O of the brain.  /(John)/
#+END_QUOTE

John's account here implies that a sufficiently high-resolution brain sensor
would accurately capture all of a person's experiences. John confirmed this
explicitly, saying /``if you could 3D print a brain, and apply the correct
electrical impulses, you could create a person in a jar.''/ In this
computational metaphor of I/O (input/output), the body itself does not have
agency; instead, the body actuates the brain's commands (output), and senses the
environment, sending data to brain for processing (input).

*** Reading the mind

As discussed in the previous section,
every participant's account of mind was strictly physical, 
rooted mostly in the brain, in a few cases in the body, 
and in one case extending beyond the body to the physical world.
With this physical understanding of the mind,
it is not overly surprising that
all participants believed it would someday be possible for a
computer to read or decode the contents of the human mind.
No participants expressed hesitation when asked about such a proposition.

For example, Alex did not feel comfortable providing a specific physical locus for the mind.
Although he did not feel the probe was accurate for him,
he took great pains to express his belief that such a device could work,
though not necessarily by sensing the brain.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We're driven by single-celled organisms in ways we don't really yet understand, but...
there's got to be some sort of physical storage of memories or experiences.
We just haven't quite learned how to read it yet. /(Alex)/
#+END_QUOTE

Though it leaves open room for a variety of interpretations 
about the exact nature of mind, 
Alex's view
is explicit that thoughts are physical, therefore /can/ be read,
and /will/ be read with some future technology.

There was a great deal of heterogeneity in the way this belief was bracketed or qualified.
Joanna felt that there would ``always be parts of the mind that can't be seen.''
She likened the question to the way that other people can know some parts of another person's mind, e.g. through empathy;
their perspective, however, would always be partial, and she felt the same would be true for machines.

However, some participants did not bracket their belief that machines would someday read the mind.
Participants for whom the authenticator worked reliably
typically said that a mind-reading machine was ``absolutely possible'' (Mary)
or ``just a matter of the right data'' (Alex).
Participants who did not feel the authenticator was accurate
described current state-of-the-art as ``crude'' (John) or ``low-granularity'' (Elizabeth).

Even Terrance, who believed the mind extended beyond the confines of the body,
felt that the mind was readable by machine.
After he stated his personal belief in a mind that extended
to the physical environment, the experimenter asked
what consequence this belief might have for the future of BCIs.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Practically, it has no implication. We could still devise an authentication tool
that does the job, and it doesn't matter. Maybe in some way there could be this
ESP thing where you could somehow read my thoughts... If we want to do
something, we will find a way. /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE

# Although he did not believe the mind to be one discrete, physical entity,
# he felt that that one could still come up with a ``convention'' by which the mind becomes readable.
# In this view, ``shorthands'' or constructed understandings hold their own reality, outside of any ``absolute'' notion of the world.
Terrance's language here belies broader narratives of positive technological progress 
(notions of ``[moving] forward,'' and that ``we will find a way'').
Despite his personal beliefs about the ``true'' nature of the mind,
he felt that engineers would manage to build the systems they intended to build,
even ones with a much higher specificity than those available today (e.g. an ``ESP device'').

*** BCIs for everyone?

Generally, participants stated (implicitly or explicitly) that BCI technologies 
would become smaller, less expensive, more accurate,
and therefore become prevalent as a consumer device.
Only Mary raised the question of how institutions exert agency 
over the artifacts they create.
Where most subjects indicated BCIs become smaller and thus more pervasive,
Mary indicated that companies have beliefs, 
which affect what devices and technologies they produce.
Specifically, Mary spoke of a ``quandary''
between advancing technology on one hand,
and systems' autonomy on the other.
She viewed this reluctance to allow systems to become more autonomous
as a signal that certain technologies, potentially including BCIs, may /not/ be developed
for ethical, moral or philosophical reasons.

Interestingly, the other seven engineers in our study
expected a future in which BCIs are pervasive,
in spite of their unwillingness to wear our probe's headband in public.
Some subjects believed the device's awkward, outward visibility
might be mitigated by future miniaturization.
Other subjects felt that social norms may simply change
if the device became pervasive. This latter attitude is reminiscent of
those around Google Glass, which shared an awkward (and, in practice, often stigmatizing)
visibility cite:wong2016product.
Future work might draw out the relationship
of Google Glass's imagined future to that of BCI,
perhaps as a way of learning lessons about possible commercial failures,
and how engineering communities may have failed to foresee them.

*** BCI anxieties

An important counterpoint to emerging technologies is the anxiety that rises
along with them cite:Pierce2017. Interestingly, engineers in our study expressed
no strong anxieties regarding the development of BCIs, for the most part.
Regardless of their experiences with our probe, participants felt that BCIs
would be developed, and would improve people's lives. Participants mentioned
domains such as work, safety, and increased convenience in the home.
# With respect to ``mind-reading'' in particular
# (which all participants agreed was a technical possibility), 
# Terrance reported that he ``really wanted it to happen.'' 
# Alex cited communication as one application of such a technology,
# and John cited virtual reality.

Only Mary reported existential anxiety about the possibility of machines that
could read the human mind. She reported a technology to be ``absolutely
possible,'' and referenced the probe's continuing high accuracy as we spoke.
However, in stark contrast to Terrance, Mary /feared/ such a development would
occur sooner rather than later.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I hope it's fifteen years out, but realistically, it's probably more like ten. /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

Despite Mary's prior statement about the power of institutions to
change the course of technical developments, here she seems to indicate that
such course changes will not occur, or that they will converge on machines that can read the mind.
When pressed on downsides, the participants who did not volunteer any anxieties
about BCI initially did mention security (especially the ``leaking'' of
``thoughts'') as a concern. For example, Elizabeth did not report any particular
anxieties about BCIs in general, ``if the proper protections are in place.''
Pressed on what those protections might look like, she cited encryption as a
solution to privacy concerns. Terrance, who expressed wanting BCIs to become
more widespread, described in deterministic terms the cybersecurity issues such
devices might pose.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If there are security holes - which there almost certainly will be - then what
happens when I'm leaking my thoughts to someone? What if I'm thinking about the
seed phrase for my Bitcoin wallet... and then you put it in this anonymized
dataset ... and I lose all my coins? What then? /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE


# Even though the probe exhibited poor accuracy for him,
# Terrance's concerns predicate a high degree of specificity about what the device is able to detect.
Even alongside his concern, Terrance very much wanted a mind-reading machine to
exist. He mentioned a desire for a programming assistant that would somehow
speed up the process of software development. Since Terrance's conception of BCI
presents high stakes with regard to privacy and security (he variously
mentioned ``telepathy,'' and an ``ESP device,'' implying a high degree of
specificity with regard to what BCIs can resolve), it is telling that he thought
primarily of using BCIs to become a more efficient engineer, rather than
concerns around privacy or potential harm. Later in the discussion, we unpack
further how larger cultural tendencies in Silicon Valley might shape the way
engineers build BCI systems.

** Discussion

# Our decision to examine the beliefs of engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area stemmed from our desire to surface narratives among engineers
# as a way of understanding what they might design.
# In particular, we wondered what kind of utopian visions and/or anxieties
# might inform the design (or reluctance to design) BCIs for everyday use.

# Since our subjects were pre-screened for potential interest in BCIs, they may have been more likely to be enthusiastic....
# We find that engineers hold diverse beliefs about what the mind is, 
# what the brain is, and about the relationship between these entities.
# However, all of these engineers shared a core belief that the mind is a physical entity, one that machines can and will decode given the proper equipment and algorithms.
# Overall, the engineers in our study were enthusiastic about the development of such devices.
# The remainder of this discussion synthesizes our findings around four core subjects.
# First, we discuss engineers' belief that BCIs will become more pervasive in the future.
# Second, we discuss the belief of a machine-readable mind shared by all the engineers in our study.
# We unpack this belief, discussing how subjects qualified, justified and defended it.
# Third, we connect our findings to implications for long-term future for cybersecurity and privacy online.
# Finally, we discuss our finding's implications for 
# how engineers, like those in our study, might design future devices,
# and how we as researchers might track their developments in the coming years.

We find that engineers hold diverse beliefs about what the mind is, what the
brain is, and about the relationship between these entities. However, all of
these engineers shared a core belief that the mind is a physical entity, one
that machines can and will decode given the proper equipment and algorithms
(Section 6.1). Despite this belief, engineers did not largely express concerns
about privacy or security (Section 6.2). As BCI startups continue to grow, we
propose further work within technical communities, with a sensitivity toward
emerging narratives, so that we may instill criticality among this emerging
technical practice (Section 6.3). We conclude with avenues for future work
focusing on different communities of technical practice (Section 6.4).

*** Physical mind, readable mind

Although our engineers broadly believed BCIs would become pervasive as consumer devices,
we found no consistent visions of what such a future might look like.
Instead, and to our surprise, we found a shared belief that
there exists a physical mind that can be ``read'' or ``decoded'' by machines,
despite participants' heterogeneous beliefs about its exact nature.
Interestingly, only one participant shared any anxiety about this prospect with the researchers; 
the other participants reported looking forward to such a possibility.

Crucial to beliefs about the machine-readable mind were frames
of the mind as physical, and therefore amenable to sensing.
In many cases, subjects would use analogies to computation in making this point.
For example, John 
observed an anomaly in the authenticator's performance (it did not work when he was listening to the experimenter speak).
He theorized that the states are distinguishable, because speaking ``is like programming'' and listening to someone speak ``is like being programmed''.
In this case, John's observations about the BCI
met with his pre-existing notions of the mind, 
producing a hypothesis for what ``brain states'' might exist
/and/ what states Muse headset might be able to detect.
Hypotheses such as these could be consequential,
as they might provide ideas or starting points for engineers looking to build systems.
Our results highlight the importance of both pre-existing beliefs
and particular interactions with BCIs 
in structuring engineers' understandings.

Broadly, engineers' beliefs about the mind-as-computer metaphor (Section [[Mind,
brain, body]]) could provide starting points for engineers to build BCIs in the
future. This computational view of mind has been popular among engineers at
least since the ``good old-fashioned AI'' (GOFAI) of the 1950s. While much work
has critiqued this stance from various angles cite:Agre1997,Hayles1999a, those
same critiques have acknowledged the role these metaphors have played in the
development of novel technologies: If the mind is a machine, then those tools
used to understand machines can also be used to understand the mind. Here, we
see this metaphor return, its discursive work now focused on biosensing rather
than on artificial intelligence. Of course, these metaphors illuminate certain
possibilities while occluding others cite:Hayles1999a. As such, future work
should follow past research cite:Agre1997 in understanding what work this
metaphor might do in its new domain of computational mind-reading.

Even those participants who did not subscribe to computational theories of mind
still believed the mind to be strictly physical. These subjects all agreed that
computers could someday read the mind, precisely because of its physical nature.
While our results indicate that engineers believe the mind to be
machine-readable, some work indicates that non-engineers may share this as well
cite:Ali2014a. Future work could further investigate this claim more deeply in
the context of consumer BCIs. If so, a machine designed by engineers and
purported to read the mind might find acceptance among a broader public
audience.


# _TODO maybe interesting to note that terrance did NOT think the mind was in the brain, but STILL thought we could "find a way" to read the mind fro brain because we can just do it by convention. so maybe unpack THAT.......if it fits here_
Those subjects with a computational account of mind tended to feel more
confident that their account was substantially accurate. John referenced ``the
consensus'' in justifying his beliefs about the mind being equivalent to the
brain. It is worth asking whose consensus this might be: that of
neuroscientists, philosophers of mind, cognitive scientists, or engineers? In
any of these cases, engineers' confidence in their beliefs could have
implications for what types of systems are considered buildable, and where
engineers might look to validate their implementations. As products come to
market, professionals in the tech industry must find ways of claiming their
devices to be legitimate, or working, to the public (consumers), to potential
investors, and to other engineers. These claims of legitimacy could prove to be
a fruitful window for understanding the general sensemaking process around these
devices as their (perceived) capabilities inevitably evolve and grow alongside
changing technologies.

*** A future for privacy and security

Since the engineers in our study believed the mind to be readable, an important
question remains around the consequences for the future of consumer privacy and
security. Our participants largely acknowledged that ``leaking'' thoughts
through security holes was a valid concern, and one participant claimed that
these exploitable holes will ``almost certainly'' exist. However, the types of
threats that engineers referenced may not square with the notion of BCIs as a
device for the masses. For example, Terrance's concern about someone stealing
his Bitcoins through some BCI-based attack involves a technology which for now
remains niche. This imagined scenario demonstrates how the security (and
privacy) concerns of engineers may not match that of the general public. Such
mismatches could have consequences for the types of systems that are designed,
and whose needs these systems will account for.

Crucially, discussions about privacy and security concerns did not cause any
participants to reflect further on the consequences of pervasive BCIs, nor did
they deter enthusiasm for the development of these devices. These findings
indicate either that engineers are not be inclined to prioritize security in the
systems they build, or that they have resigned themselves to the inevitability
of security holes in software. In either case, our findings suggest a long-term
direction for cybersecurity concerns. These devices carry potentially serious
security and privacy consequences. If our engineers will try to build devices
that make judgments about the inner workings of a person's mind, future work
must critically examine how to protect such systems, and the people who use
them.
# Even those participants who believed that BCIs
# could ``leak thoughts'' with relative specificity
# felt the development of these same technologies 
# to be at once appropriate, desirable and inevitable.

*** Implications for the design of mind-reading machines

Our findings do not indicate a singular path for the future of BCIs. Instead,
they indicate an undercurrent of belief among Silicon Valley engineers in the
possibility of technologies that can read the contents of the human mind.
Crucially, our study revealed narratives not just around BCIs, but around the
nature of the brain and mind generally, which in turn legitimize narratives
about the possibility of mind-reading machines.

Despite these beliefs about what BCIs are capable of, only one participant in
our study reported that ethical issues around privacy or security might deter
their development. We hope engineers will become more reflexive about these
beliefs around BCI, and more critical about their downstream potential for harm
(e.g. surveillance). Much as utopian dialogues around the potential of the World
Wide Web missed risks to privacy and security, so might similarly utopian ideals
of mind-reading machines.

Since the engineers in our study believed BCIs could perform this potentially
invasive ``mind-reading,'' why did they largely want such BCIs to be built?
Explanations might be found by relating the narratives we uncover to existing
social and economic value systems within Silicon Valley communities. Biohacking,
for one example, has become an established part of Silicon Valley culture,
through dieting (e.g. Soylent, fasting), or more extreme forms of body
modification (e.g. chipping) cite:Dolejsova2017. Underlying all of these
cultures is a mechanical model of the body, which facilitates notions of
optimization and experimentation. How might BCIs (especially ones that purport
to read thoughts) work their way into these already-established cultural
patterns? We note that existing consumer BCIs already situate themselves in this
context: the Muse headset we used in this study markets itself primarily as a
meditation trainer (its advertising copy claims to ``remove the uncertainty from
meditation'') cite:Interaxon. Examining how BCIs perform discursive work in
engineering communities will allow us to better understand engineers' intents as
these devices begin to emerge, and help us trace these intents forward as
devices are re-imagined, remixed and repackaged for other groups of users in the
future.
# Meditation also harkens to 
# eastern spirituality generally, 
# which has a long-entrenched history in the Bay Area, and in the software engineering community at large _[?????]_.
# (Indeed, two of our participants picked a yoga sun salutation as one of their mental gestures).

In the nascent field of consumer BCI, researchers and designers should remain in
touch with the beliefs of engineers. We pinpoint beliefs about the mind, and its
readability by emerging biosensing devices, as especially an critical facet.
Doing so will allow design to remain preemptive rather than reactive as software
for consumer BCI emerges. Designers and researchers must not remain on the
sidelines; as devices come to market, we must become actively engaged in
engineers' beliefs (and practices). These systems hold the potential for
exploiting an unprecedented level of personal data, and therefore present an
high potential for harm. As such, the area presents a new locus for researchers
and designers to engage critically with technical developments.

# *** TODO BCI & biopolitics
# _??????????????? should I bring biopolitics into this or is that a separate paper ??????????????? Matthew sample ?????????????????_

*** Future work

Software engineers are a diverse group, and the geographic confines of Silicon
Valley do not describe all communities worldwide. Future work could explore
communities in different places. Engineers in non-Western contexts may hold
different cultural beliefs about the mind, which could lead to vastly different
findings.

# Even within Silicon Valley, engineers are heterogeneous in their cultures, interests and practices.
# Future work could focus on a few, specific sub-populations with the Silicon Valley technology community.
Professionals who work in machine learning could present another
participant pool for future work. Machine learning is a critical component of
BCIs, and many contemporary techniques, particularly deep
learning, use neural metaphors to interpret and designing algorithms
cite:ba2016using. Thus, practitioners of these techniques may be inclined to draw
metaphors between the brain and the algorithms they employ, which could color
their understanding how and why BCIs work or fail.

# For example, employees in private companies actively working on building brain-computer interfaces
# could provide a useful point of comparison to the software engineers in our study, who were not BCI experts.

Future work could allow participants to take an active, participatory role in
the analysis of their data, and/or in the design of the BCI system. Although our
participants had the technical expertise required to perform data analysis and
systems engineering themselves, we did not have participants do any such
analysis for this study. This participatory approach will also help us expand
our understanding from engineers' beliefs to engineers' practices, as they
relate to the emerging domain of consumer brain-computer interfaces.
Participants might form their own interpretations of what the data mean (or can
mean), building understandings that could differ from those we observed in this
study.

# future work could perform
# ``speculative enactments'' _[elsden]_ with our research tool, in which activities with the device
# could result in real-world consequences.
# For example, people must authenticate with our device in order to log into their real services.
# These deployments might necessitate longer-duration experiences with the device, as well. 
# Deployments with real stakes, over longer timescales, could radically change the interpretations and beliefs that our study elicits.

** Conclusion

# With regard to the brain and mind, what is their truth?
As engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area, the participants in our study sit at
an historical site of techno/political power. Our technology probe indicates
these engineers believe the mind is physical, and therefore amenable to sensing.
What are the consequences for the rest of us? I hope this study will encourage
engineers to closely examine the potential of these devices for social harm, and
encourage researchers to remain closely attuned to this emerging class of
consumer biosensor.

What this study did not rigorously examine is how the engineers in our study
encountered notions of identity as it might be captured by the brain scanning
device. In general, although engineers broadly believed the mind to be readable
by machines, this chapter did not deeply examine to what extent they believed
the identity to be related to the mind or the brain. In the following chapter, I
examine participants' responses through this lens, charting engineers' beliefs
about the readability of identity as an aspect of mind.

* Telepathy within limits
<<conclusion>>

What are the limits of what machines could model of the mind? My arguments in
this dissertation reorient this question around human beliefs: What are the limits
within which claims of mind-modeling might be made (by designers), and believed
(by end-users)? I propose the term /telepathy/ to describe the process of
understanding models of minds. I then use this term to motivate work for
charting the limits of what work telepathy might perform in the world.

** Telepathy

Earlier in this dissertation, I reframed prior research programs as having built
/models of minds/, showing how work in philosophy unwittingly supports their
claims. By analyzing critiques of these research programs, I highlighted the
primacy of human beliefs, both designers' and users', in structuring how models
of minds are built, and understood as relevant.

Building models of minds can be split into two major components: the
designerly program of building algorithms that encode and represent mental
states, and the social processes of understanding these representations as
relevant in the course of life. While the boundary between these components is
intrinsically unstable, the split is nonetheless useful in understanding how
these models perform work in the world.

To describe the latter component, I propose the term /telepathy/. While this
term has a strong connection to magic, I believe it is useful to repurpose the
term for discussions about computational models of minds, and how they are
understood by people. Consider telepathy's etymological pedigree in relation to
other popular technologies.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Telephony (/tele + phonos/) 
  Sound at a distance

Television (/tele + vīsiō/) 
  Sight at a distance

Telepathy (/tele + pathos/) 
  Mind at a distance.
#+END_VERSE

While the first two terms may have sounded like magic at some point in history,
technical infrastructures have provided functionality that made these terms
legible not just as technologies but as social media. /Telepathy/ is in spirit
no different. In relation to the other technical infrastructures, the prefix
/tele-/ highlights technical aspects of transmission, along with the various
sociotechnical infrastructures and entanglements that make transmission,
encoding, and decoding possible. Telepathy works to describe how models of minds
are ``made and measured'' cite:Boehner2007b, while gesturing toward the unstable
boundary between these two activities.

# In general, neither users nor engineers will likely have academic training about
# the philosophy of mind. However, they do have /ideas/ about the mind, stemming
# from culture, lived experience, popular media, etc, and that biosensors can both
# bring these ideas to the surface and alter them over repeated interactions.
# Future work should continue to study how beliefs about the mind inform the way
# engineers model it, and how users understand these models as relevant in the
# course of life. Through such work, we can begin to understand what role(s)
# telepathy might play in the world. The next section briefly imagines such roles,
# charting future work that can help to appreciate the limits of telepathy.

What might telepathy be used for? Answers to this question relate deeply to the
beliefs of users and designers. Thus, the relevant questions here include: What
are the limits within which claims of telepathy might be made, or believed? How
might emerging infrastructures of ubiquitous bodily and environmental sensing
assist such claims, by ascribing higher resolution to their models? Or detract
from them by making biosensory data mundane, thus challenging their presumed
authority? Future work should deeply examine engineers' beliefs, how they change
with evolving technologies, and how these beliefs affect (and are affected by)
technical practices. Beliefs about the mind will continue to co-evolve along
with our rapidly changing technical capacity to sense and model the world.

** A big loop


#+CAPTION: A big loop, in which beliefs about the mind structure technologies that are built (and considered working). These technologies go on to structure beliefs about the mind, and so on. This dissertation has examined the right side of this loop, but not the left.
#+NAME: bigloop
[[./figures/bigloop.png]]

Rather than presenting a theory of mind and technologies that do or do not sense
it, this work gestures toward the relationship between beliefs about the world
and how they relate to the perceived capabilities of technology. The cases in
this dissertation gesture toward one half of a big loop (Figure [[bigloop]]). In the
right half of this loop, beliefs about the mind affect the technologies people
build (and accept as working). This dissertation examined this half of the loop.

However, the left half of this loop depicts existing technologies, some of which
claim to read the mind, affecting beliefs about what the mind /is/. This
feed-foward loop of mind-reading technologies and ideas about ``mindhood''
raises the possibility that minds are not only readable because people believe
they are, but because the very notion of mindhood will change relative to
existing claims of mind-reading. How do we, through sensing minds, (re)make
minds (and ourselves) through the things that sense them?

# similar to hacking's thesis that categorical members define the category they belong to
# ... seems like a trivial thesis ... but whatever

The shifting of categorical boundaries, especially as it relates to shifts in
technological infrastructures, has been the concern of philosophers of
technology cite:bowker2000sorting and feminist scholars cite:Haraway1988b for
many years. Future work should integrate these perspectives in an examination of
the other half of our big loop, or in an examination of the loop itself. For
example, an old question, ``Are minds machines?'' comes under new light through
this frame cite:Winograd1987.

I suspect the coming years will provide opportunities to study these questions
longitudinally, as technologies develop and become more diffuse. The remainder
of this chapter discusses another set of longitudinal concerns, which should be
studied in parallel: security, privacy, and surveillance.

** Security, privacy and surveillance

While models of minds could include data about the brain, such data is not
necessary to decode the mind, as this dissertation argues. Indeed, with
ubiquitous enough sensing, the world at large could be (re)purposed to sense the
mind. Consider the minimal example of a lightswitch. It not only takes input
from people, but its design (at least the canonical version) is carefully
crafted to permit only the intentional finger-action of a person. Thus, its
state can be taken as a correlate of the beliefs and attitudes of the
switcher(s) cite:Tolmie2016.

If IoT devices can turn anything cite:Zhang2017 into a biosensor, what
surprising features might be generated from these data? Given the potentially
sensitive data that telepathy might yield, and the unclear mechanisms of intent
or consent by which models of minds might be generated, future work must also
engage deeply with existing work across surveillance studies, media studies and
gender studies.

In Simone Browne's seminal history of surveillance in the United States
cite:browne2015dark, a racial, gendered and historical situatedness illuminates
relationships between surveillance and power. While Browne's history does not
paint an optimistic picture for information technologies, Mcmillian Cottom's
work on black cyberfeminism cite:Cottom2016 shows how the same tools of Browne's
surveillance can be repurposed to evade surveillance, and for activism. Future
work in telepathy should substantially engage with analyses such as these, so
that we may better understand both what new power structures telepathy might
create, and which existing ones it might (re)inforce.

Related to the sensitivity of mental data, telepathy pushes against the limits
of what information assurance (IA) might mean. Traditionally, IA is concerned
with the integrity, availability, authenticity, confidentiality and
non-repudiation (inability to challenge authorship) of data; if the contents of
mind become the stuff of data, then telepathy will plot fresh territory for
cybersecurity research.

** Conclusion

The purpose of this dissertation is twofold. First, it surfaces an unstable
boundary between sensing bodies and sensing minds. Second, it proposes the
porousness of this boundary as a site for studying the impact that biosensing
devices will play in near future. As biosensors creep into smart watches, bands,
and ingestibles, they will build increasingly high resolution models of bodies
in space. Their ability to divine not just what these bodies do, but what they
think and feel, presents an under-explored avenue for understanding and
imagining the role these technologies will play in everyday life.

# Go on after first sentence, turn this into a 3-paragraph conclusion.
This dissertation aims to paint a few provocative dots on a very large canvas.
As sensors continue to saturate our environment, people will continue to build
increasingly high-resolution models of our bodies and minds. Machines' purported
ability to divine not just what these bodies do, but what they think and feel,
will prove to be a key concern for privacy, personal autonomy, and cybersecurity
in the coming hundred years. It will also generate novel opportunities for
communication, accessibility, business, and entertainment. By paying close
attention to the beliefs and practices of engineers, and the expectations of
