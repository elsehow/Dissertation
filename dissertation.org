Machines will someday read the mind.
I know. But they will.
``We'' will find a way to make them,
and ``we'' will use any tools at our disposal to do so.

The primary tool we will use is our own interpretation, and theories
of the mind, projecting it onto a physical reality
that is less definite than ``we'' would sometimes like to imagine.

Who is this ``we''?
This dissertation looks primarily (though not exclusively) at software professionals
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

* How to sense a mind


This chapter outlines how theories of a mind that is embodied (beyond the
brain), distributed (beyond the individual), and extended (to the built
environment) make the mind amenable to sensing by emerging classes of wearable
and environmental sensors.
# I don’t think the “true” nature of the mind matters to me. what matters is
# that engineers will find a way to decode the mind, because they will structure
# and define “mind” and “decoding” such that it becomes amenable to their
# objectives. the question is, what are the consequences for the rest of us?

we believe some physical theory will eventaully explain the mind.
Where do we look for such theories?

*** OUTLINED Cognitive science's physical mind
Cognitive science has historically been an influential source of such theories.
Cognitive science's goal was and is a computational *model* of cognition.
Much like physics can inform structural engineering, can these models inform 
neurosciecne [gallant], psychology [griffiths], AI [hawkins, minsky, bengio/ut guy], design [norman].
Compelling evidence for computational complexity explaining certain time-related tasks in psychological stimuli [e.g. Shepherd & Metzler, 1971]
have inspired countless computational models, often in the form of flow diagrams that neatly compartmentalize cognitive ``processes'' such as long-term or short-term memory, attention, etc.

causal role in that agent's cognitive processing."
For example, offloading cognitive work onto the environment.

**** OUTLINED Distributed cognition
Challenge 2: Focus on the invidiaul.
As Clark et al propose, 
"...technological resources such as pens, paper, and 
personal computers are now so deeply integrated into 
our everyday lives that we couldn’t accomplish many 
of our cognitive goals and purposes without them."

* TODO Reading mind from heartrate

While the previous chapter argues that certain framings of the mind make it
amenable to reading by sensors, this chapter seeks to discover whether /users
believe/ that biosensors can capture aspects of mind. Through a vignette study
and a mixed-methods experimental study, this chapter show how people use
biosensory data (heartrate) in social, computer-mediated contexts to build
interpretations relating to the minds of others.

*** Abstract

We investigate interpretations of a biosignal (heartrate) in uncertain social
interactions. We describe the quantitative and qualitative results of a
randomized vignette experiment in which subjects were asked to make assessments
about an acquaintance based on an imagined scenario that included shared
heartrate information. We compare the results of this experiment in adversarial
and non-adversarial contexts of interaction. We find that elevated heartrate
transmits cues about mood in both contexts, but that these cues do not appear to
impact assessments of trustworthiness, reliability and dependability. Counter to
our expectations, we find that normal (rather than elevated) heartrate leads to
negative trust-related assessments, but only in an adversarial context. Our
qualitative analysis points to the role of social expectations in shaping
contextual interpretations of heartrate, and reveals individual differences in
the way interpretations are constructed. We unpack some of the ways that social
meanings can arise from biosensor data, and discuss considerations for those
designing interactions with wearables.

*** Introduction

What could your heartrate possibly tell another person about you? Past work has
cited intimacy as a grounds for heartrate sharing [1,16,21,26]. However, it is
not clear that these applications capture the full expressive capacity of
heartrate as a computermediated cue. Does sharing a heartrate always “enhance”
intimacy and trust? What is the social interpretation of an elevated heartrate
in different contexts of interaction?

As biosensors become smaller and cheaper, more consumer devices are presenting
users and application designers with opportunities to share their physiological
data with others [18,22,23]. In fact, designers are already beginning to play
with the notion that social and contextual interpretation may color people’s
interpretations of biosignals. The advertising copy for Cardiogr.am, one
smartwatch app, reads,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Your heart beats 102,000 times per day, and it reacts to everything that happens
in your life—what you're eating, how you exercise, a stressful moment, or a
happy memory. What's your heart telling you?
#+END_QUOTE

This application, along with many others, capitalizes on the idea that people
project contextual interpretations onto heartrates, making them potentially
interesting to share socially. However, few empirical studies examine how
context shapes the interpretation of another person’s heartrate [25], or how
these interpretations might affect attributions of mood or emotion, or
fundamental social attitudes such as trust.

In this paper, we investigate how individuals make social interpretations about
a rudimentary biosignal (heartrate) in conditions of uncertainty, focusing on
dyadic interactions between acquaintances. Dyadic relations, which are present
in all groups, function as a fundamental starting point for understanding
interpersonal collaboration and group interactions [4]. We describe the
quantitative and qualitative results of a randomized vignette experiment in
which subjects make assessments about an acquaintance based on an imagined
scenario that included shared heartrate information. We examine two contexts in
this study: an uncertain, non-adversarial context and an uncertain, adversarial
context. These two contexts, differing only by a few words, ask participants to
imagine they are meeting someone "for a movie" (non-adversarial) or "to discuss
a legal dispute” (adversarial).

We find that a high heartrate transmits negative cues about mood in both
contexts of interaction, but that these cues do not appear to impact assessments
of trustworthiness, reliability or dependability. Counter to our initial
predictions, we find that normal (rather than elevated) heartrate leads to
negative trust-related assessments, but only in the adversarial context. In
qualitative assessments of subjects’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that normal
heartrate in the adversarial condition conflicts with expectations about how the
participant believes the acquaintance should feel, signaling a lack of concern
or seriousness, which appears to lead individuals to view the acquaintance as
less trustworthy. In contrast, subjects in the non-adversarial context relate
elevated heartrate to empathy and identification rather than trustworthiness. We
also find a small number of subjects read different social interpretations onto
the heartrate signal, including a very small minority who did not infer any
relationship between the heartrate and the social situation.

Where past work establishes that heartrate has contextual meanings, this study
aims to establish the relative effect of the elevated (versus normal) signal on
social attitudes regarding trust, reliability and dependability. Understanding
these effects could shed light on why people agree or refuse to disclose
biosignals in interpersonal relationships and groups, and what individuals risk
by making such disclosures. As we better understand the social interpretations
of biosignals, we can inform the design of technologies that facilitate
biosignal sharing in groups.

*** Social interpretations from physiological signals

To date, most work on the contextual interpretation of sensor data
has focused on individual interpretation of individual data (c.f.
quantified self). In contrast, our work attempts to move toward an
understanding of how biosignals are interpreted in interpersonal
interactions – the quantified social self. This shift is motivated, in
part, by an increasing number of consumer applications that
support sharing biosignals such as heartrate. Especially pertinent
to our study, it is not well understood what heartrate actually
signals to another person in a social interaction. How might the
contextual, social interpretation of another person's biosignals
affect social interpretations of mood (e.g., anxiety, calmness), or
attitudes about trustworthiness and dependability?

Goffman [12:56] makes an important distinction between the cues
that we intend to give to others, and those that are “given off”
unintentionally through our numerous non-verbal actions and
behaviors. We view physiological signals such as heartrate as a
form of non-verbal signaling that can “give off” more information
to others than the sender may desire [15]. This type of personal
data revealed through discreet sensors paired with mobile
communication technologies has, until recently, been unavailable
in most forms of social interaction.

As Donath (2007) argues, when we use communication
technologies for interpersonal and group interactions, we do so as
a way to keep track of our evolving relationships with other
people and, critically, to know whom to trust [10]. Crucially, we
rely on signals such as verbal communication, facial expressions,
gestures, and other patterns of activity to help us fill the gap
between what someone is doing and why they are doing it [11].
So, when new forms of biosensory information, like heartrate, are
suddenly available in social interaction, significant questions arise
surrounding the inferences that we might draw from these signals,
how the context in which they are presented may shape our
interpretations, and how this information may affect our
subsequent beliefs and behaviors towards others.

**** Contextual interpretations of sensor data

Prior work interrogates the contextual interpretation of personal data from
certain kinds of sensors [6,7], but physiological data has received less
attention, despite two crucial differences from sensors that capture information
such as location (e.g., GPS). First, biosensor data are intrinsically ambiguous:
whereas a GPS coordinate refers to one specific place, heartrates do not have
oneto-one mappings to physical activities or emotions. Second, physiological
phenomena vary from person to person; 60bpm could be high or low depending on
whose heartrate it is. A relatively large body of work has looked at how the
transmission of physiological data might play a role in computermediated
communication. One class of application has attempted to explicitly encourage or
discourage certain behavioral outcomes, making some biosignals apparent such
that the transmission of the data acts as a social cue [2,19]. Another class of
prototypes explores how signals might affect feelings of intimacy, particularly
between romantic partners [1], and several applications focus on the
transmission of heartrate as a means to achieve this effect [16,25,26].

Despite a number of applications that transmit biosignals socially, there
remains little work on how people interpret the biosignals they see from others.
Past studies on heartrate sharing indicate that people do read social emotional
cues in the heartrates of other people [20,25]. However, it is still not
well-understood what social meanings these signals take on in different social
contexts and, in contrast to the findings of previous studies, it is not clear
that the social consequences of transmitting physiological data will always be
positive (e.g., increased intimacy).

In this study, we are particularly interested in trust, due its centrality to
the study of group behavior, and to the claims of prior research on heartrate
sharing [16]. We apply the encapsulated interest view of trust [14], in which
one person’s interest is intrinsically connected with the interests of another
person [5]. Since trust between individuals is only salient in the presence of
risk and uncertainty [8], we test our hypotheses about the effects of heartrate
information on evaluations of trust in social contexts with different degrees of
risk and uncertainty.

**** The social meaning of a heartrate

Compared to social interpretations of physiological signals,
interpretations of one’s own signals are slightly better-understood
from empirical research. Individuals’ interpretations of their own
heartrate have received particular attention (see [24] for a review).
Studies have generally revealed that, when individuals believe
that their heartrate is elevated, they sometimes believe their mood
and emotions to be more negative [27].

If lay interpretations of one’s own heartrate can yield negative
self-interpretations, sharing heartrate information could also yield
negative effects on mood and trustworthiness, particularly during
uncertain interactions where something is at stake (such as time,
money, or other valued resources). To investigate, we use a
mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative
analyses of a survey-based vignette experiment.

*** Interpreting biosignals in uncertain social interactions

Based on aforementioned studies of individual's negative
emotional interpretation of their own heartrate, we believe that
this negative valence will be mirrored in people’s interpretations
of the heartrates of others in uncertain situations. Our
investigation begins with two key predictions about negative
assessments of one’s partner in an uncertain social situation. We
test both hypotheses in two different contexts of interaction
(adversarial and non-adversarial) to understand how the context of
risk and uncertainty affects social interpretations of heartrate.

**** Heartrate and Mood
Past work indicates that people tend to make negative inferences
about mood and emotion from elevated heartrates [9,13,27]. As
such, our first hypothesis predicts that participants will adjust their
attitudes about the mood of their partner when their partner’s
heartrate is elevated, as opposed to normal:
Hypothesis 1: When individuals believe that their partner has an
elevated heartrate in an uncertain social interaction, they will 
report their partner as being (1a), less calm (1b), more emotional
(1c), and more easily upset (1d), compared to those who believe
that their partner has a normal heartrate.

**** Heartrate and Trustworthiness
Where Hypothesis 1 predicts that individuals will make negative
assessments about an acquaintance’s mood based on elevated
heartrate, our second hypothesis predicts that individuals will
make negative assessments about dispositions to behave in a
reliable, dependable and trustworthy manner. Thus, both
hypotheses stem from the same base assumption that, all things
being equal, elevated heartrate has a primarily negative
connotation with attitudes and behaviors of another person.
Hypothesis 2: When individuals believe that their partner has an
elevated heartrate in an uncertain social interaction, they will
make negative assessments about the partner’s trustworthiness
(2a), reliability (2b), and dependability (2c), compared to those
who believe that their partner has a normal heartrate.

*** A survey-based experiment

To test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey-based vignette
experiment. Vignette studies involve short descriptions of a
scenario, designed to elucidate opinions, attitudes, and beliefs
about that particular situation [17].

In this vignette study, we compare two different contexts of
interaction. We do not create separate hypotheses for the two
different contexts; rather, we are interested in comparing and
contrasting the two different contexts to see how they might
interact with social interpretations of heartrate. We provide our
participants with either an adversarial or a non-adversarial social
context. In the adversarial scenario, the participant is waiting to
meet an acquaintance about a legal dispute. In the non-adversarial
scenario, the participant is waiting at a movie theater for an
acquaintance so that they can see a film together.

In all scenarios, the acquaintance sends a message via smartphone
indicating that he or she is running late due to slow traffic. The
person who is waiting does not know if the acquaintance will
make it on time or not, or whether the acquaintance is being
honest about their tardiness. Within each context, we manipulate a
small piece of information about the heartrate of the acquaintance:
We tell the participant that the heartrate of the acquaintance has
been shared by the acquaintances’ smartphone and it is either
elevated or normal.

**** Sample

Our sample was undergraduate students recruited from the
population of a large, public university on the West Coast of the
U.S. Potential participants were asked to participate in a short
online survey, and they did not know the nature of the questions
or the topic of the study in advance. All participants were paid a
$5 Amazon gift card. One hundred and three participants (103)
completed the experiment survey instrument. The pool was
weighted toward women; in our sample, 65% were women and
34% are male, and 2% (2 subjects) did not identify with either
gender. With random assignment, the same overall gender split
was maintained across conditions. The mean age of participants
was 23.

**** Vignettes
Each participant in the study saw only one of the four possible
vignettes. After the vignette, the survey included free response
questions about subjects' reactions to and interpretations of the
situation described in the vignette, as well as 7-point Likert scale
questions (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) in which subjects
evaluated the other person's disposition (“This person is
emotional”, “This person is anxious”, “This person is easily
upset”, and “This person is calm”). In addition, we asked
participants to indicate whether the other person was
“trustworthy,” “reliable,” and “dependable” using the same 7-
point agreement scale.

There are two contexts of interaction (adversarial and nonadversarial)
and two heartrate conditions (normal and elevated),
creating four distinct vignettes based on social context and
heartrate (HR): adversarial elevated HR, adversarial normal HR,
non-adversarial elevated HR, and non-adversarial normal HR.
Participants were randomly assigned into one of the four
conditions. We manipulated these heartrate conditions by making
a key wording change as indicated in the two context vignettes
below.

**** Quantitative results

We apply both quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate our research
questions and hypotheses. The study is based around an experimental design, but
we also place significant emphasis on open-ended responses to better understand
participants’ thought processes, beliefs, and rationale for their choices in the
vignettes. Our first hypothesis predicts that individuals will make negative
attributions about the mood of the acquaintance in this uncertain situation when
they believe that the acquaintance has an elevated heartrate (compared to normal
heartrate). Given our four separate measures of mood, we conducted a
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test the hypothesis that there are
one or more mean differences between the normal/elevated heartrate conditions,
and/or between the two contexts of interaction (nonadversarial and adversarial).

We found a strong, statistically significant effect and a medium practical
association between emotional attributions and heartrate condition, F (4, 96) =
32.89, p < .001; partial eta squared = .58. Turning to the individual outcomes,
we find that subjects’ perceptions of the acquaintance in the vignette’s
anxiety, his/her tendency to be easily upset, his/her tendency to be emotional,
and his/her lack of calmness were all significantly higher in the elevated
heartrate conditions when compared to the normal heartrate conditions (see
Figure 1). We found no significant effect for the two contexts of interaction, F
(4, 96) = 1.072, p = .38, and no significant effect for the context x heartrate
condition interaction, F (4, 96) = 1.65, p = .17. In sum, individuals
significantly rate acquaintances with elevated heartrate as more anxious, easily
upset, and less calm than those with normal heartrates. In the non-adversarial
context, individuals did not rate the acquaintances as significantly more
emotional in the elevated condition compared to normal, but this difference was
statistically significant in the adversarial context.

The context of interaction (non-adversarial, adversarial) does not have any
effect on mood ratings. With clear statistical and practical significance for
the overall effect of mood attributions by heartrate condition in both contexts
of interaction, Hypothesis 1 is supported.

Our second hypothesis predicts that individuals will make
negative assessments about how certain they are regarding the
acquaintances’ trustworthiness characteristics when the individual
has an elevated versus a normal heartrate. We find a statistically
and practically significant effect for the heartrate conditions, F (3,
97) = 4.19, p < .01; partial eta squared = .12. However, we also
find statistically significant effects for both the context of interaction, F
(3, 97) = 2.82, p < .05, and the context x heartrate condition interaction, F
(3, 97) = 2.75, p < .05.

A closer inspection of the individual mean differences reveals that the means
for all three outcomes (reliability, dependability and trustworthiness) are all
lower in the normal condition compared to the elevated condition in the
adversarial context (see Figure 2). This result is the opposite of what
Hypothesis 2 predicts. In the non-adversarial context, we find no statistically
significant differences in trust-related evaluations between heartrate
conditions. Thus, it is the interaction between the context and the heartrate
condition that explains the results: individuals rate acquaintances with normal
heartrates significantly lower in terms of trustworthiness, dependability and
reliability than those with higher heartrates—but only in the adversarial
condition.

Individuals do not rate acquaintances any differently on these three outcomes
between the heartrate conditions within the nonadversarial context. In fact, the
means for these outcomes are very similar across all conditions and contexts,
with the sole exception of the adversarial, normal condition. The mean
differences for the trust-related outcomes between the normal and the elevated
conditions within the adversarial context are all highly statistically
significant (p < .01) and highly practically significant: Cohen’s d = 1.1
(trustworthiness); 1.07 (dependability); 0.68 (reliability). Hypothesis 2 is
therefore not supported. However, the strong findings (statistically and
practically significant) in the opposite direction from our prediction warrant
further exploration in the qualitative results and discussion below.

*** Qualitative results
Directly after the vignette, participants were asked four freeresponse questions
about their reactions to the situation described in the vignette: 1) How do you
react to this message, 2) What makes you react this way, 3) What is the ideal
outcome of this situation, and 4) What is the worst possible outcome of this
situation? The open-field responses were coded into two broad, non-overlapping
categories: those that mentioned a negative emotional reaction to the scenario,
and those that included a mention of what the other person in the situation
might be thinking or feeling. Responses in the latter category were further
sub-divided by experimental condition for analysis.

**** Adversarial Context

This section reports on the qualitative analysis of free responses
given by subjects in the adversarial (legal dispute) context.

***** TODO Normal heartrate

_Figure 1. Mood-related evaluation means by condition (bars represent standard deviation)._

_Figure 2. Trust-related evaluation means by condition (bars represent standard deviation)._

In the adversarial (legal dispute) context, many subjects who saw
a normal heartrate directly indicated that they were negatively
adjusting their appraisal of the other person, either in their
sympathy toward the other person, or in their judgment of that
person’s trustworthiness. We find that normal heartrate in the
adversarial condition appears to be in conflict with the subjects’
expectations about how the acquaintance should feel.

I will feel less sympathetic to this person because their heart rate
doesn’t show that they are stressed or upset.

I feel annoyed because a higher heart rate would indicate that the
person cares about the meeting

The normal heartrate implies that my acquaintance isn’t taking
this meeting seriously. However, it is difficult to say that my
acquaintance does not care or is lying. For example, I have no
knowledge of the traffic to determine if my acquaintance is lying.
#+END_QUOTE

Here, participants read a lack of care or concern into the
acquaintance’s normal heartrate, but did not feel the biosignal
provided definitive evidence as to whether or not the acquaintance
was being truthful. For some participants, however, normal
heartrate indicated deception:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I would think this person is lying. If they were in a rush, their
heartrate would be faster.

I feel like he is lying and is taking his time. I say "hurry up please
I can’t wait any longer. You are lying to me" It makes me angry to
see that his heartrate is normal through all of this. Mine is spiking
out of control.
#+END_QUOTE

These responses could help to explain the surprising quantitative
results of Hypothesis 2 in the adversarial context: the intersection
of the adversarial context with normal heartrate led many
participants to view the acquaintance as unsympathetic and, in
some cases, disingenuous. As we see below, these negative
reactions stand in stark contrast to the interpretations in the
elevated heartrate condition.

***** Elevated heartrate

In general, participants in the adversarial context viewed elevated
heartrate as a signal that the acquaintance cared about being late.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Since it shows that the person is trying their best to come, as
shown by the elevated heartrate, I would still feel ok.

I would believe my acquaintance. An elevated heartrate tells me
she is probably rushing/hurrying over. I have data from the phone
to validate what she is saying to a certain extent.
#+END_QUOTE

In these quotes, participants used the elevated heartrate to validate
their acquaintance’s claim, thus positively assessing their honesty.
A few subjects spoke to the power of data in creating what
appeared to be objective facts about the other person.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I won’t be angry because seeing this person’s heart rate being
elevated, it must mean they’re in a hurry. Seeing metrics make it
easier to believe someone.

I feel like I’m in a position of power. With the capacity to check
someone’s heart rate, I can instantly tell how they are feeling. In a
way, it is almost like a lie detector.
#+END_QUOTE

In both of these quotes, we see attitudes about the presumed
authority or “neutrality” of data interacting with beliefs about the
body (namely, the relationship between heartrate and emotion, or
truthfulness), creating a context in which wearables data can be
used to construct social judgments or assessments. How these
assessments play out will vary in different social situations, with
different sensors, and in different contexts of use. Such variations
should be explored much more deeply in future work.

**** Non-Adversarial Context

This section reports on the qualitative analysis of subjects in the
non-adversarial context (meeting for a movie),

***** Normal heartrate

In the non-adversarial context, many participants reported that
normal heartrate conveyed a lack of appropriate social concern:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At first I believe that maybe my acquaintance is running late;
however, when I discover that their heart rate is normal I wonder
why it isn't higher…

It seems like they are too nonchalant about it

I feel frustrated because it seems like the person isn't concerned
about making me wait.
#+END_QUOTE

In these cases, interpretations focused on what the other person
was thinking or feeling. As we saw in the adversarial context,
normal heartrate seems to be in conflict with expectations.
However, unlike in the adversarial context, we did not find
evidence that subjects were re-appraising their trust toward the
other person. Interestingly, two participants read the normal
heartrate positively, as a sign that the other person was telling the
truth.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If his heartrate is normal, then he is probably not lying. I would
still be slightly annoyed at this.

it’s OK. her heartbeat was normal, so no lies
#+END_QUOTE

These subjects seemed to feel annoyed by the partner’s normal heartrate.
However, in contrast to the adversarial context, no subjects explicitly stated
that the other person seemed less trustworthy, honest or reliable as a result.

***** Elevated heartrate
The majority of respondents in the non-adversarial indicated that
the elevated heartrate was a token of the other person’s regret for
being late to the movie. Many participants in this condition
indicated that they would have a more sympathetic reaction to the
text message as a result of seeing an elevated heartrate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Elevated heart rate tells me that the acquaintance at least cares
that he/she is late and there's no point in getting mad.

I would text her back "No problem! I'll grab the tickets and will
wait for you out front." It seems obvious she's in a hurry to get
there, and is late because of traffic.

I will feel apologetic because I can see that this person's heartrate
is elevated and I do no want him/her to feel worried/ stressed
about making a movie.

I would feel anxiety about being late for the movie and pity
because they seem anxious. I don't like being rushed and get
anxious when I am rushed
#+END_QUOTE

In these responses, heartrate generally seemed to signal that the acquaintance
was stressed. While stress is generally assumed to be negative, in this case it
seems to engender identification and empathy with the acquaintance. This example
gestures toward the highly contextual nature of heartrate’s social meaning, and
why more work should examine the consequences of these different
interpretations.

**** Other interpretations of heartrate: Relevance, validity, creepiness

In addition to the major themes noted above, we also found a few
other important interpretations. A small handful of participants 
(12 total) mentioned aspects other than the immediate social
interaction in relation to the shared heartrate display. The points
that surfaced surrounded concerns about privacy, doubts about the
accuracy of the sensing device, and doubts about the relevance of
heartrate to the particular context.

***** Privacy and disclosure concerns

Only three subjects in the entire experiment pool (n=103)
commented on the potential for invasiveness or over-disclosure in
heartrate sharing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(non-adversarial + normal heartrate) ``I feel like I'm violating my
acquaintance's private information by knowing their heart beat.''

(adversarial + normal heartrate) ``I do suspect the person is lying
since his heart rate is normal. I think the extra info of the heart
rate is the reason I have a neg. suggestion towards the person. I
think the reported heart rate is a bad idea.''
#+END_QUOTE

Given that heartrate sharing is not (yet) widely deployed in
consumer devices, it is somewhat surprising that only a few
subjects commented on privacy concerns. This could be partially
explained by the fact that the scenario was imagined, rather that
simulated, and because subjects might have anticipated our
interest in their reactions to the interface.

***** Validity of the device’s data

Four subjects mentioned the possibility that the device, or the
intuitive inferences drawn from it, may be inaccurate.
(adversarial + elevated heartrate) Heart rate could be elevated
for many reasons, and just like studies with lie detectors, it may
possibly indicate lying, but also could indicate other things. It’s
just a number, not a definite answer of lying or not. And even
then, you’ve got to forgive people.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(adversarial + normal heartrate) ``The normal heartrate implies that my
acquaintance isn’t taking this meeting seriously. However, it is difficult to
say that my acquaintance does not care or is lying. For example, I have no
knowledge of the traffic to determine if my acquaintance is lying. Additionally,
my smartphone can be wrong; I don’t know how accurate this technology is,
especially since it is a very new piece of technology.''
#+END_QUOTE

Our study did not reference any existing device, so it is possible that the
fallibility of particular devices was not on subjects’ minds. However, the trust
that people place in sensing devices, and the presumed authority of their data,
should be explored thoroughly in future work.

***** Relevance of heartrate to the social situation

Only two subjects in the study who mentioned heartrate felt that the data
was not necessarily related to the specific social situation described in the
vignette:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(non-adversarial / elevated heartrate) ``My initial reaction would
probably be to ask them if everything is okay. Their heart rate
should probably not be elevated since they are only driving and
weather conditions are not abnormal.''

(adversarial / normal heartrate) ``There may be reasons why
his/her heartrate is normal and why he/she may be late in the first
place, so I'm not concerned about that.''
#+END_QUOTE

Across all conditions, the fact that the vast majority of participants
inferred a causal relationship between the heartrate information
and the particular social situation highlights the relatively reliable
effect of context in priming subjects to draw such inferences. Our
results indicate that simply making the heartrate salient, in the
absence of other cues, invites people to project a causal narrative
on the mood, intentions, and behavior of others.

*** Discussion

We began this investigation by asking how individuals might interpret heartrate
information in uncertain social interactions. Our hypotheses are both based on
the simple rationalization that the kinds of negative attributions that people
tend to make about their own heartrate will be echoed in their social
interpretations of others’ heartrates in uncertain contexts. We found, however,
a much more complex story about the social interpretation of biosignals and the
context of interaction.

Our first hypothesis predicts that an elevated heartrate will be negatively
associated with assessments about mood and dispositions in uncertain social
interactions, both adversarial and non-adversarial. We found strong support for
this hypothesis in both contexts, across our outcome attributions, in line with
prior works’ findings regarding interpretation of one’s own heartrate [24]. Our
second hypothesis predicts that an elevated heartrate will lead to negative
assessments about the partners’ trustworthiness, dependability and reliability.
As with our first hypothesis, we expected that pre-existing negative
connotations with heartrate might translate into negative expectations of
trustrelated behavior.

We rejected the second hypothesis in both contexts of interaction. In the
non-adversarial context, we found no difference in assessments of
trustworthiness, dependability or reliability in the elevated and normal
heartrate conditions. Furthermore, we found that the average assessments on
these three outcomes were nearly identical between the elevated condition in the
adversarial context and the elevated and normal conditions in the
non-adversarial context.

Most surprisingly, we find a decrease in trustworthiness, dependability, and
reliability in the normal heartrate condition, but only in the adversarial
context. As noted in the quantitative results, the differences between the
elevated and normal conditions in the adversarial context were highly
statistically significant: each of the trust-related measures saw an average
decrease of one full point (on a 7-point scale) in the normal condition compared
to the elevated condition.

To help explain these results, we turn to our qualitative analyses of the
adversarial (legal dispute) context. Subjects in the adversarial context seemed
to have expected their partner to have an elevated heartrate. When the partner
had a normal heartrate, participants viewed it as evidence that s/he is not
bothered enough, not taking the situation seriously, or perhaps even lying.
Indeed, many participants explicitly stated in the open text responses that they
trusted the partner less because his or her heartrate was normal.

Why do we not see the same effect in the non-adversarial context? Turning again
to the qualitative data, we find that participants took elevated heartrate as a
token of their acquaintances’ genuine desire to arrive on time. It seems that
elevated heartrate led many participants in the non-adversarial context to
increase their empathy, identification, and understanding of the partners’
situation. Thus, even though individuals in the non-adversarial condition
associate elevated heartrate with anxiety, lack of calmness, and being easily
upset, the negative emotional interpretations do not seem to translate to
evaluations of one’s trustworthiness, dependability or reliability.

Taken together, we see that heartrate does not inherently (or consistently)
affect trust-related outcomes. Instead, social expectations shape
interpretations of the heartrate biosignal to create highly contextual,
socially-specific meanings. CMC researchers have long noted that, when cues are
omitted from technology-mediated interaction, people tend to fill in the gaps
[3,10]. However, individuals may interpret new types of interpersonal data in
ways we do not yet understand. Our work provides some evidence that such
interpretations might have real social consequences. The fact that heartrate
alone can significantly alter one’s perception of trustworthiness in an
adversarial context is an important step towards the larger goal of unpacking
social interpretations (and their effects) in technologysupported social
interaction. (For one thing, the mostly positive social interpretations of
heartrate observed in past work are likely highly dependent on the social
context in which they were observed).

Finally, we note a diversity of opinions and interpretations within conditions.
For example, a few subjects took normal heartrate as proof of honesty, the
opposite view from the majority of subjects. A few subjects did not feel there
was necessarily any relationship between heartrate and the social situation at
hand. A small minority (three subjects) mentioned concerns around privacy or
disclosure. The wide range of views, sometimes contradictory, highlights the
complexity intrinsic to interfaces that collect and share biosignals, and
warrants future studies into social and contextual interpretation of data from
wearable devices.

*** Limitations

Our vignette experiment examined a single type of scenario in two different
contexts, using text-based answers. We still have a limited picture of the range
of theoretically important contexts in which individuals may observe and
interpret biosignals about others, and a limited understanding of how the rich
cues present in realistic interaction contexts might bare on our findings. Our
study focused on a first-time interaction with an imagined heartrate sharing
interface. We do not know how our findings would hold over time, and it is very
likely that social meanings of any biosignal could become more consistent over
time. The vignette scenario was contrived from believable, but currently
non-existent smartphone technology. Either due to participants’ suspension of
their disbelief or due to their actual attitudes about the heartrate sharing,
few participants raised questions regarding privacy implications of these
scenarios.

Since the vignette study took place online, we could have missed the sorts of
rich contextual cues that might be captured by live interviews or other
in-person methods. Furthermore, the internet presents a wide array of
distractions to survey-takers, and our survey was not able to detect the
participants' attention on the task (e.g.., we could not detect whether the
subject was switching between tabs in their web browser, or taking breaks during
the survey), nor did we monitor how long subjects spent filling out the survey.

*** Future work

Our experiments provide evidence that interpretations of biosignals from sensors
(such as wearables) can affect social attributions and behaviors towards others.
Nevertheless, many questions persist. Future work should approach similar topics
with controlled, lab-based experimental methods. Controlled, behavioral
experiments could help us ask more specific questions about how elevated
heartrate affects perceptions of risk in uncertain interactions, e.g. when money
is at stake. Such studies could lead to a more robust understanding of how the
transmission of biosignals might affect social behavior. Future work should also
investigate the degree to which our findings are unique to heartrate. Other
biosignals (e.g., galvanic skin response, electroencephalography or EEG), could
offer different affordances for sense-making. It is unclear from our work how
the social interpretation of the signals from these devices could affect social
behaviors such as dyadic and group trust.

Future work should also investigate the mechanisms by which contextual
interpretations of heartrate arise. Specifically, future work should study the
effect of the signal's representation on the attributions made by participants.
In this study, subjects saw a normative interpretation of heartrate ("elevated"
versus "normal"); however, it is unclear how a more more or less ambiguous, or
more or less numerical interface might have affected our results. Meanwhile, the
meaning of a given biosignal is certainly mediated by a number of factors,
including culture and lived experiences. Much work remains in determining how
biosignals give rise to any interpretations, and to what extent these
interpretations are influenced by both beliefs about a given signal and the way
interfaces represent this signal.

Finally, future work should more closely examine the relationship between
people’s social interpretations of biosensor data, and their assessment of the
risk associated with disclosing these signals. As biosensing devices become more
pervasive, people will more often be faced with decisions to disclose these data
to others, either socially, or for services (e.g., health care, insurance) [23].
Consumers’ willingness to (or refusal) to disclose their signals will certainly
stem from their intuitive interpretation of what these signals might say about
them, at least in part. As such, processes of consent in disclosing wearables
data present a clear priority for future work.

*** Conclusion

We find that sharing heartrate can negatively influence trusting attitudes.
However, heartrate alone does not communicate trust. Instead, individual’s
social expectations interact with the heartrate data to produce context-specific
meanings. Complicating matters further, our qualitative data reveal a diversity
of interpretations regarding the relevance and meaning of a heartrate in
context, and the privacy implications of biosensing technologies. Our findings
advance and complicate our understanding of the role that biosignal sharing can
play in social, computer-mediated contexts, and motivate more detailed study
into the mechanisms by which social interpretations arise from basic
physiological signals.
