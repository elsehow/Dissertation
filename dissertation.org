* Mind-reading & telepathy for beginners and intermediates


This chapter outlines how theories of a mind that is embodied (beyond the
brain), distributed (beyond the individual), and extended (to the built
environment) make the mind amenable to sensing by emerging classes of wearable
and environmental sensors.
# I don’t think the “true” nature of the mind matters to me. what matters is
# that engineers will find a way to decode the mind, because they will structure
# and define “mind” and “decoding” such that it becomes amenable to their
# objectives. the question is, what are the consequences for the rest of us?


#
# Spicy mood intro
#

Would you wear a device in the workplace if your manager used it to track your
productivity, or creativity? Would you allow your child wear the same device in
schools, where it could monitor both their academic achievement and their mental
health? Would you wear a fitness tracker if your resting heartrate could predict
your future involvement in violent crime? 
# What about the variety of brainwave-sensing headbands that detect your stress, mood, or help "remove the uncertainty from meditation?

In all of these examples, sensing technologies blur the line between /sensing
bodies/ and /sensing minds/. Today, increasingly inexpensive sensors with
developer-friendly SDKs and APIs allow those with requisite software expertise
to purport to detect phenomena ranging from focus to mental health to mood---all
without direct data about the brain.
# Given the general encroachment of biosensing in everyday life, this paper asks:
# If these devices can build models of our bodies, can they too build /models of
# our minds/?

#
# Description of paper & forward references
#

In this paper, I seek to dethrone the assumption that brain-scanning is
necessary for computers to ``read'' or ``decode'' the mind. Drawing from
contemporary theories of embodied, extended and distributed cognition, I argue
that pervasive biosensors are already able to grasp at the contents of our minds
by sensing our bodies, tools and built environment (Section [[beyondbrain]]). I
relate this argument to ongoing work affective computing, computational social
science, and biosensing, reframing these research programs as having already
begun the work of theorizing and building computational /models of minds/
(Section [[modelsofminds]]).

Drawing on critiques of this past work, I center the primacy of human
interpretation in both constructing MoMs and interpreting their relevance in
daily life. I propose these processes of construction and interpretation as a
starting point for understand what MoMs are, and how they might operate in the
world (Section [[interpretation]]).

** Background
<<beyondbrain>>

# https://phys.org/news/2017-11-zombie-ant-brains-left-intact.html
# WHAT DOES THE LATIN TRANSLATION MEAN?  it's the speices name "in the broad sense"
Consider the ant. The fungal complex /Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato/
overtakes its behavior without operating on its brain at all (Figure [[antfig]]). Instead,
it uses the ant's body to feed itself, constructing a network of coordinated
sensing and actuation atop the ant's muscles cite:Fredericksen2017.
# creates meta-brain ontop of existing muscle system ?

#+CAPTION: /Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato/ takes control of an ant's mind without input from its brain. It forces the ant to chews on the underside of a twig, after which the ant's body will serve only as a medium for fungal reproduction.
#+NAME: antfig
[[./figures/just-ant.jpg]]

 # TODO On the lower-left, a single fiber of an ant mandible adductor muscle is overtaken by /Ophiocordyceps unilateralis/ filaments.


Ignoring questions of control, consider the degree of /sensing/ the fungus must
perform in order to maintain and use the ant's body. Using the ant's existing
bodily infrastructure, the fungus creates a /model/ of ant-experience robust enough to
control the organism completely. Although the /Ophiocordyceps/ fungal
complex cannot read the ant's brain (it has no physical presence there), it can
read the ant's /mind/ well enough to model its environment and body. The
fungus's model of ant-experience may not be the same, or even similar, to those
used by the host ant. Regardless, they are of a sufficient resolution to allow
the fungus to acheive its (reproductive) goals.


With this fungus in mind, consider the emerging class of IoT devices, which are
increasingly embedded in the built environment, worn on the body, worn /in/ the
body via ingestible pills. Though mundane, cameras too sense bodies often in
public, often without subjects' knowledge cite:DBLP:journals/corr/SedenbergWC17.
In all of these examples, connected devices are endowed to some degree with the
capacity to sense (that is, to build models of cite:Gitelman) human bodies in
space. Past work refers to this process broadly as /biosensing/, and these
devices as /biosensors/ cite:day2016biosensing.

While humans are significantly more complex than ants, this fungus helps
illustrate the possibility of creating /models of minds/ with limited or no
information from the brain. As I review in this section, contemporary
philosophical theories engage seriously with the notion of a /beyond-the-brain
mind/. I continue in the following section to argue that these theories
(unwittingly) provide grounds to claim that even current biosensors can build
/models of minds/.

*** Contemporary (material) theories of mind

What is the mind? What is its relationship to the body, and to the physical
world? Philosophers have proposed two basic catagories for answers to this
question. /Dualism/ posits that the mind has non-physical components, whereas
/physicalism/ posits a mind of only physical components. (For a slice of this
debate, see cite:Chalmers1998).

# get the more critical folk on board right away
The physicalist stance of mind squares with Jane Bennett's account of
/thing-materialism/, in which things in the world have an intrinsic power,
locked in networks of interactions with other things cite:Bennett2013a. In turn,
this materialism squares the physicalist account of mind with the project of
biosensing cite:day2016biosensing,nafus2016quantified. If mental phenomena are
physical, then mental phenomena are potentially the subject of sensing.
Bennett's /Thing-Power/ at once justifies the strict physicalism that allows
biosensing to refer to phenomena in the mind, and justifies the systems of
reference that make observations from biosensors /about/ the mind.

*** Cognitive science

Moreover, the physicalist interpretation lends itself naturally to scientific
study. From the physicalist perspective, all phenomena in the mind can, be
reduced to descriptions of physical activity, some physical theory could
eventually explain the mind in entirety. Cognitive science has historically been
an influential source of physicalist theories about the mind. It takes a
computational account of the brain, understanding how it ``processes
information'' cite:Winograd1987a within the physical constraints of
computational space and time. Its questions operate above the biological
concerns of neuroscience, but below the behavioral concerns of psychology,
offering computational /models/ of ``cognition.''

As physical models can inform structural engineering, cognitive scientific
models have informed research across psychology, artificial intelligence, and
design cite:Agre1997. Some early studies provided evidence for computational
complexity in time-related tasks cite:shepard1971mental, which have in turned
inspired numerous models of cognition. These models informed the design of
neural networks, before the relatively recent discovery of performant
backpropogation algorithms made neural networks practical to deploy
cite:minsky1969perceptrons.

# Challenges to cognitive science
# Dreyfus, 1992, /What Computers Can't Do/
# Winograd & Flores, 1986, /Understanding Computers & Cognition/
However, cognitive science has received considerable criticism
cite:Noe2004,Winograd1987a. Two critiques relevant to this paper focus on
cognitive science's ``isolationist assumtions'': a focus on the brain (isolated
from the body), and a focus on the individual (isolated from social context, and
from the environment). The following three sections review major responses to
these critiques: embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and extended
cognition.

*** Embodied cognition

Cognitive science's isolation of the brain rests on the belief that the brain is
strictly equivalent to the mind. This assumption has encountered two primary
critiques. First, the dichotomy between the brain and body is intrinsically
unstable; neurons occur body-wide, running directly to the brain, such that it
is difficult to evaluate the role of cerebral neural activity in the functions
of mind irrespective of non-cereberal neural activity. Second, to quote Noë and
Thompson (2004), ``The exact way organisms are embodied simultaneously
constrains and prescribes certain interactions within the environment.''
cite:Noe2004. In other words, aspects of mind exist because of the physical
conditions of an organism's body in the world.

These critiques ultimately resulted in the /Embodiement thesis/: that an agent's
beyond-the-brain body plays a causal role in that agent's cognitive processing.
As one example, Noë and O'Regan's analysis of vision recasts the ``visual
processing'' of cognitive science, in which internal representations are built
and manipulated within the brain, to an active, embodied process, in which the
seen world provides its own representations, which the body and brain must meet
through an active process of co-adaptation cite:ORegan2001a.
In its account of vision as an active process of co-construction,
this analysis shares with some work in feminist epistemology, e.g. cite:Haraway1988b.

*** Extended and distributed cognition

While embodied cognition addresses the critique of cognitive science's isolation
of the brain, it does not cognitive models' isolation of the indivdual from
social or environmental context. Further, while the embodiement thesis points
out the causal relationship between mind and the physical conditions of the
body, it glosses over the relationship between these bodies and the world in
which they are situated. In response, Clark's Extended Cognition thesis argues
that the environment at large can be considered as part of the mind. Clark et
al propose that ``technological resources such as pens, paper, and personal
computers are now so deeply integrated into our everyday lives that we couldn’t
accomplish many of our cognitive goals and purposes without them'' cite:Clark1998.

# TODO explain   D COG    merge with above graf for 1 long graf
This theory does not stop at tools, however, in describing a mind beyond the
body. Broadly, extended cognition refocuses the brain away from the individual
body, and toward the general ``active role of the environment in shaping
cognition'' cite:Clark1998. This theory paved the way towad a socially-extended
cognition, or ``distributed cognition,'' as proposed in Hutchins' (1995)
ethnography of sailors on a naval vessel cite:hutchins1995cognition. In his
analysis, multiple individuals and the material environment play constituent
roles in cognition, a mind that is distributed across multiple human and
non-human actors.

# Though I do not cover activity theory in depth here, suffice to say the theory
# covers many of the same topics, though its intellectual history was quite remote
# from the other theories mentioned (having "grown up" in the USSR). for a review,
# see _review_.

The theories in this section establish make various cases for a mind that extends beyond
the confines of the brain, and even beyond the confines of the body. With these
theories in mind, the next section argues these theories make the mind amenable
to modeling via sensors that are worn or embedded in the environment.

** Models of minds
<<modelsofminds>>

*** TODO intro
The theories outlined in the previous section all propose that the mind is
physically instantiated in the material world. They differ only on /where/ this
mind exists, and where it does the work of cognition. Embodied cognition focuses
on the body's role in cognition, where extended and distributed cognition
theorize cognition as a process distributed across human and non-human actors.

Using embodied distributed, and extended cognition, this
section argues that contemporary and emerging biosensors are already able to
sense the human mind through interactions with the body and built environment,
and through the constituency of sensing devices in cognition and experience.
I use two strands of existing work, reading each through a
different account of mind: affective computing through the lens of embodied
cognition, and computational social science through the lens of distributed and
embodied cognition. Through these readings, I recast each program of pervasive
sensing as a program of /reading the mind/.

To assist in this analysis, I propose the notion of /models of minds/. This term
borrows from the term /theory of mind/ which, in autism research, refers
to the ability to reason about mental states cite:Baron-Cohen1995. By
substituting the word ``theory'' with the word ``model,'' I emphasize the notion
of formal or algorithmic representations. By then turning this ``model of mind''
(singular) into /models of minds/ (plural), I center the intrinsic
contestibility of the algorithms that build them, and the beliefs that underlie
their construction, as well as the many minds in the world to model. The term
aims to cast a subtle doubt on models that appear too simple, or which claim to
generalize across all people.

Building /models of minds/ can be split into two major components: the
designerly program of building algorithms that encode and represent mental
states, and the social processes of understanding these representations as
relevant in the course of life. While the boundary between these components is
intrinsically unstable, this agential split is nonetheless useful in
understanding how these models perform work in the world. To these two
components, I assign the terms /telepathy/ and /mind-reading/, respectively.
While these two terms, especially the latter, have a strong connection to magic,
I attempt briefly to explain the useufulness of repurposing them for discussions
on computational models of minds. Consider telepathy's etymological pedigree in
relation to other popular technologies.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Telephony (/tele + phonos/) 
  Sound at a distance

Television (/tele + vīsiō/) 
  Sight at a distance

Telepathy (/tele + pathos/) 
  Mind at a distance.
#+END_VERSE

While the first two terms may have sounded like magic at some point in
history, technical infrastructures have provided functionality that made these
terms legible not just as technologies but as social media. /Telepathy/ is in
spirit no different. In relation to the other technical infrastructures, the
prefix /tele-/ highlights technical aspects of transmission, along with the
various sociotechnical infrastructures and entanglements that make transmission,
encoding, and decoding both possible and desireable.

In contrast, /mind-reading/, a term associated with street and stage magic 
cite:Ali2014a, re-focuses on human aspects of interpretability and legibility.
It centers the processes of meaning-making and the performance of understanding.
Together, /mind-reading/ and /telepathy/
work to describe how models of minds are ``made and measured'' cite:Boehner2007b,
while gesturing toward the unstable boundary between these two activities.

The remainder of this section reads work in affective computing through the lens
of embodied cognition, and computational social science thruogh the lens of
distributed and extended cognition. Through these readings, I demonstrate how
existing work in biosensing has already built models of minds, and in so doing,
offer various examples of what mind-reading and telepathy might mean in
practice. These analyses provides context for a discussion in the following
section on the primacy of human beliefs---both on the part of designers and
users---in structuring mind-reading and telepathy.

*** Affective computing

Affective computing, pioneered by Rosalind Picard at the MIT Media Lab, sought
to _QUOTE PICARD+CITE_. Affective computing seeks to model emotions in order to
improve user interfaces with machines. A central vision of this project is to
endow computers with the ability to perform emotions. Tightly intertwined with
this goal, affective computing seeks to detect emotions in users. In this
program, affective computing is concerned with mind-reading in the sense that
other people perform it: the construction of a ``theory of mind''
cite:Baron-Cohen1995.

Affective computing, as it has been framed historically, has received a variety
of critiques. First, work in affective computing has tended to frame emotions as
definite entities in the world, for which a ground truth exists. Boehner et al
cite:Boehner2007b posit an alternative interpretation of emotions as
co-constructed, performed socially and understood only in collaboration with
other socially-experiencing subjects. An account of socially-situated emotions
has received some limited uptake within affective computing cite:Parkinson2015;
however, these theoreis still pre-catagorize emotions, which may obscure other
phenomena at the borders of these categories cite:Boehner2007b.

# Second, even with the premise that emotions are definite entities for which
# catagories can be known, affective computing has yet to find the ground truth
# required to sense the emotions it seeks to capture. Since the nature of emotions
# remains a point of active debate, it is not clear how affective computing
# systems might validate their metrics and responses.

Second, affective computing has not substantively engaged with the question of
how algorithms and devices that seek to detect emotion may affect the way
emotion is experienced or performed. To quote Cecil Adams, ``the act of
observing disturbs the observed'' cite:Adams1982. Feedback about emotional
experience may alter emotional experience as well _[CITE]_.

_well with all these critiques, why are we bothering to talk about affective computing?
_because it relies on notions of emotion as embodied states that can be detected from physiological input_ _[HEALEY]
_relies on data from the body to encode and transmit emotion - an aspect of mind_.

*** TODO Computational social science

_Past work has attempted to perform social science using sensors worn or embedded in the build environment_.
_These efforts predate contemporary IoT, existing mostly in labs_.
_One early example is Sandy Pentland's Sociometer, which I can describe a little_.
_ubicomp, proximate future_.

_Aided by infrastructures of machine learning that require large, multi-subject corpora, finding relational and longitudinal dependencies in the dataset_.
# perhaps affective computing hits this spec as well ^

Indeed, the world of computational social science has shifted from proximate future to lived present.
From the commerical world of target advertisements, 
to the public-sector world of pervasive surveillance.
The legacy of Pentland's work lives on in our connected present.
_easy critique that looked from perspective of manager, sought to make workspaces more efficient etc_

_TRAJECTORIES OF DEPRESSION_
_if u believe depression to be an embodied phenomenon, then the phone does sense depression through the body, reather than its bodily correlates_.
_if u believe depression to be an extended phenomenon, then the cellphone is in fact /a constituent part of the depression/, and can report the ground truth of the depression_.

_these stances are relevant in understanding how mind-reading and telepathy are constructed via the interaction of human beliefs and material configurations_,
_how these theories make it possible to seek ground truth_
_such that models can be said to be (in)accurate_.
I discuss the centrality of human intepretation in the following section.

_TODO cite boehner first of all_

*** User interpretations

*** Construction of engineers

*** Writing that exists somehow

If people /think/ a certain technology measures aspects of mind, it will
certainly affect the way they engage with that technology---whether or not it
works the way they expect cite:Ali2014a. Meanwhile, if they think that a given
technology does *not* measure their mind, when it fact it does, users may suffer
a breach of what Nissenbaum might call the ``appropriateness of the flow of
information'' cite:Doyle2011. In both cases, knowing what people expected will
help us anticipate their needs, and concerns.

There are some people who actually /want/ their minds measured. In these cases,
technologies that claim to ``measure the mind'' must rely on end-users to define
the criteria by which systems are deemed effective, or accurate. Consider the
Spire, a breath sensor that claims to divine, from a person's patterns of
in-breaths and out-breaths, what the user is calm, focused, or tense
cite:SpireInc. For the device to ``work,'' not only must these detected signals
match with end-users' intuitions, but users must also believe that a device like
the Spire has the power to measure and detect these phenomena, given breath as
input cite:Ali2014a. Of course, these attitudes will not be fixed: they will
evolve over time, as users observe the device in action, and correlate its
judgments with their own lived experiences cite:Nafus2016.

# why physical matters
Crucially, assumed connections between the readings of these sensors and the
phenomena they purport to measure can break down. A cat could accidentally flip
a lightswitch cite:Tolmie2016; a heartrate sensor could give a false reading.
Mismatches between what a signal is ``supposed to'' refer to, and what it
actually refers to, highlight the other crucial aspect of biosensing: /that it
relies on beliefs about the physical world/, baseline hypotheses that allow
readings from these sensors to be classified as accurate or inaccurate
cite:Boyd2013. And, of course, ``raw data is an oxymoron'' cite:Gitelman; the
way data are presented in specific contexts define what human interpreters are
and are not able to see cite:Day2014. One useful point of comparison can be
found in Nafus's (2016) cite:Nafus2016 description of how she began her studies
of biosensing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Figuring out whether a consumer market for biosensors was even thinkable had
everything to do with whether the data they produced cohered with a cultural and
social imaginary, such that users stood a chance of making sense of them.
#+END_QUOTE

# NOTE -- I am 'not so sure' about the last part, given my heartrate findings.
# people can make up new meanings in the absense of strong prior beliefs (tho
# these cultural/socail imaginaries play a large role in shaping interps.)

# In my view, it is these ``cultural and social imaginaries,'' via their imagined
# systems of reference to particular phenomena in the world, that /cause/
# biosensing /to be/ biosensing, as opposed to any other type of sensing. 
This revelation belies the legibility that allows biosensing to become meaningful in daily life.
it is the step of active, interpretive construction that turns sensing into biosensing, as it takes on reference to living systems,
or a MoM, as it takes reference to a human mind.

In other words, the way the mind is conceived has consequences for the way
technoogies are employed to sense it cite:Rose2016. Only someone who believes
emotion is socially situated would sense an entire organization to understand
how someone is feeling cite:OlguinOlguin2009,Healey2010,Aharony2011. Past work
has touched on how preexisting categories of phenomenal experience /make/ these
phenomena amenable to detection or classification cite:Boehner2007b. Theories of
how the mind is physically instantiated drive the pursuit of detecting
particular phenomena. After all, bodies are not transparent. An inherent
ambiguity exists in what data from sensors can mean, or what it would mean for
these data to be accurate.


_Describe project of knowing what end-users *and engineers* think aout this_.
_Contrast with STS proiject of scientists in labs_.
Now, users and engineers outside of lab environments will parttake, wittingly or not, and with varying degrees of formality, in this centuries-old project of Western rationalist inquiry.
_Lead into the next section_.

* Reading mind from heartrate

While the previous chapter argues that certain framings of the mind make it
amenable to reading by sensors, this chapter seeks to discover whether /users
believe/ that biosensors can capture aspects of mind. Through a vignette experiment
and a mixed-methods experimental study, this chapter show how people use
biosensory data (heartrate) in social, computer-mediated contexts to build
interpretations relating to the minds of others.

** Introduction

As of 2016, several apps allow users to share their heartrate with their
friends, leading some cite:McNell2015 to wonder why anyone would anyone want to do such a
thing. In fact, heartrate is a potentially rich signal for designers. The
meaning of a heartrate in any given context is at once socially informative 
cite:Frey2016a,Slovak2012
and highly ambiguous 
cite:Merrill2010a.

After all, heartrate is not just some number. The sense of one’s heartbeat is an
integral feature of the human experience, and people’s associations with it
range from intimacy cite:Janssen2010 to anxiety cite:Decaria1974 to sexual
arousal cite:Valins1966. Many heartrate sharing applications rely on these
associations, asking users to ascribe contextual meanings to heartrate
cite:Kastrenakes2014,Slovak2012, often with the aim of increasing intimacy
cite:Janssen2010. The advertising copy for Cardiogr.am, one smartwatch app, reads,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Your heart beats 102,000 times per day, and it reacts to everything that happens
in your life—what you're eating, how you exercise, a stressful moment, or a
happy memory. What's your heart telling you?
#+END_QUOTE

These applications, along with many others, rely on the fact
that people will imbue their heartrate data with emotional, and highly
contextual interpretations. Given the relatively large number of wearables with
embedded heartrate monitors (watches, bands, even earbuds) cite:Stables2016, it
is unsurprising that designers are looking beyond fitness and health for ways to
increase user engagement with these devices. However, it is not clear how
individuals will interpret a shared biosignal (e.g. heartrate) in different
contexts of social interaction.

This chapter examines what heartrate can mean as a computer-mediated cue,
and how interpretations of heartrate affect social attitudes and social behavior
as people assign meanings to these signals relevant to the mind (emotion, mood, trust).

First, we use a vignette experiment to investigate how individuals make social
interpretations about a rudimentary biosignal (heartrate) in conditions of
uncertainty, focusing on dyadic interactions between acquaintances. Dyadic
relations, which are present in all groups, function as a fundamental starting
point for understanding interpersonal collaboration and group interactions
cite:Cheshire2010. We describe the quantitative and qualitative results of a
randomized vignette experiment in which subjects make assessments about an
acquaintance based on an imagined scenario that included shared heartrate
information. We examine two contexts in this study: an uncertain,
non-adversarial context and an uncertain, adversarial context. These two
contexts, differing only by a few words, ask participants to imagine they are
meeting someone "for a movie" (non-adversarial) or "to discuss a legal dispute”
(adversarial).

We find that a high heartrate transmits negative cues about mood in both
contexts of interaction, but that these cues do not appear to impact assessments
of trustworthiness, reliability or dependability. Counter to our initial
predictions, we find that normal (rather than elevated) heartrate leads to
negative trust-related assessments, but only in the adversarial context. In
qualitative assessments of subjects’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that normal
heartrate in the adversarial condition conflicts with expectations about how the
participant believes the acquaintance should feel, signaling a lack of concern
or seriousness, which appears to lead individuals to view the acquaintance as
less trustworthy. In contrast, subjects in the non-adversarial context relate
elevated heartrate to empathy and identification rather than trustworthiness. We
also find a small number of subjects read different social interpretations onto
the heartrate signal, including a very small minority who did not infer any
relationship between the heartrate and the social situation.

From these findings about social attitudes, we then move to an lab-based experiment
to understand how shared heartrate effects social behavior. We apply
quantitative and qualitative analyses to an iterated prisoner's dilemma game, in
which heartrate information (“elevated” or “normal”) was shared between players.
In a follow-up study, we replicate our initial study, but replace heartrate with
an unfamiliar biosignal, “Skin Reflectivity Index (SRI).”

Our results raise important questions for applications that transmit
sensor-derived signals socially between users. For signals with strong cultural
associations, people’s prior beliefs will color their interpretations, and
social outcomes may or may not be positive. In the case of novel signals, on the
other hand, our results imply that designers can (perhaps inadvertently) teach
users to associate these biosignals with social meanings. This effect could be
viewed as beneficial, depending on design objectives. It could also be dangerous
if designers suggest, perhaps even inadvertently, interpretations that lead to
discrimination.

# something here to tease how this fits into larger argument, or nah?

** Background

*** Sharing sensor data

To date, most work on the contextual interpretation of sensor data has focused
on individual interpretation of individual data (c.f. quantified self). In
contrast, our work attempts to move toward an understanding of how biosignals
are interpreted in interpersonal interactions – the quantified social self. This
shift is motivated, in part, by an increasing number of consumer applications
that support sharing biosignals such as heartrate. Especially pertinent to our
study, it is not well understood what heartrate actually signals to another
person in a social interaction. How might the contextual, social interpretation
of another person's biosignals affect social interpretations of mood (e.g.,
anxiety, calmness), or attitudes about trustworthiness and dependability?

Goffman cite:Goffmann1959 (p 56) makes an important distinction between the cues
that we intend to give to others, and those that are “given off” unintentionally
through our numerous non-verbal actions and behaviors. We view physiological
signals such as heartrate as a form of non-verbal signaling that can “give off”
more information to others than the sender may desire cite:Howell2016. This type
of personal data revealed through discreet sensors paired with mobile
communication technologies has, until recently, been unavailable in most forms
of social interaction.

*** Sharing physiological data


Prior work interrogates the contextual interpretation of personal data from
certain kinds of sensors cite:Choe2011a,Consolvo2005, but physiological data has
received less attention, despite two crucial differences from sensors that
capture information such as location (e.g., GPS). First, biosensor data are
intrinsically ambiguous: whereas a GPS coordinate refers to one specific place,
heartrates do not have oneto-one mappings to physical activities or emotions.
Second, physiological phenomena vary from person to person; 60bpm could be high
or low depending on whose heartrate it is. A relatively large body of work has
looked at how the transmission of physiological data might play a role in
computermediated communication. One class of application has attempted to
explicitly encourage or discourage certain behavioral outcomes, making some
biosignals apparent such that the transmission of the data acts as a social cue
cite:Bergstrom2011. Another class of prototypes explores how signals might
affect feelings of intimacy, particularly between romantic partners
cite:Bell2003, and several applications focus on the transmission of heartrate
as a means to achieve this effect cite:Janssen2010,McNell2015.

*** Sharing heartrate

Heartrate has deep-rooted cultural significance in many societies, and
near-universal familiarity as a feature of our lived experiences. Building on
associations with intimacy and love, many heartrate sharing applications have
aimed to “enhance” social connectedness by fostering feelings of intimacy
cite:Janssen2010,hassibheartchat between people.

What heartrate means as a computer-mediated cue, however, is ambiguous, its
potential interpretations varying widely in different contexts
cite:Lotan2007,Slovak2012. Boehner et al (2007) argue for the intrinsic
ambiguity of sensor data as a resource in design, particularly in systems that
seek to use these data to express emotion cite:Boehner2007b. Many technology
probes corroborate this stance, relying on users to project socially contextual
meanings around a transmitted heartrate. Consequently, more recent work has
challenged the notion that the social consequences of transmitting physiological
data will always result in increased trust and intimacy. There remains little
work, however, on how the potential ambiguity of a heartrate signal is resolved
in social conditions of risk and uncertainty.

** Vignette experiment

This section describes the quantitative and qualitative results of a randomized
vignette experiment in which subjects were asked to make assessments about an
acquaintance based on an imagined scenario that included shared heartrate
information. We compare the results of this experiment in adversarial and
non-adversarial contexts of interaction. We find that elevated heartrate
transmits cues about mood in both contexts, but that these cues do not appear to
impact assessments of trustworthiness, reliability and dependability. Counter to
our expectations, we find that normal (rather than elevated) heartrate leads to
negative trust-related assessments, but only in an adversarial context. Our
qualitative analysis points to the role of social expectations in shaping
contextual interpretations of heartrate, and reveals individual differences in
the way interpretations are constructed. We unpack some of the ways that social
meanings can arise from biosensor data, and discuss considerations for those
designing interactions with wearables.

Compared to social interpretations of physiological signals, interpretations of
one’s own signals are slightly better-understood from empirical research.
Individuals’ interpretations of their own heartrate have received particular
attention (see cite:Parkinson1985 for a review). Studies have generally revealed
that, when individuals believe that their heartrate is elevated, they sometimes
believe their mood and emotions to be more negative cite:Young1982a.

If lay interpretations of one’s own heartrate can yield negative
self-interpretations, sharing heartrate information could also yield negative
effects on mood and trustworthiness, particularly during uncertain interactions
where something is at stake (such as time, money, or other valued resources). To
investigate, we use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and
qualitative analyses of a survey-based vignette experiment.

*** Hypotheses

Based on aforementioned studies of individual's negative emotional
interpretation of their own heartrate, we believe that this negative valence
will be mirrored in people’s interpretations of the heartrates of others in
uncertain situations. Our investigation begins with two key predictions about
negative assessments of one’s partner in an uncertain social situation. We test
both hypotheses in two different contexts of interaction (adversarial and
non-adversarial) to understand how the context of risk and uncertainty affects
social interpretations of heartrate.

**** Heartrate and Mood

Past work indicates that people tend to make negative inferences about mood and
emotion from elevated heartrates cite:Decaria1974,Gu2012,Young1982. As such, our
first hypothesis predicts that participants will adjust their attitudes about
the mood of their partner when their partner’s heartrate is elevated, as opposed
to normal: Hypothesis 1: When individuals believe that their partner has an
elevated heartrate in an uncertain social interaction, they will report their
partner as being (1a), less calm (1b), more emotional (1c), and more easily
upset (1d), compared to those who believe that their partner has a normal
heartrate.

**** Heartrate and Trustworthiness

Where Hypothesis 1 predicts that individuals will make negative assessments
about an acquaintance’s mood based on elevated heartrate, our second hypothesis
predicts that individuals will make negative assessments about dispositions to
behave in a reliable, dependable and trustworthy manner. Thus, both hypotheses
stem from the same base assumption that, all things being equal, elevated
heartrate has a primarily negative connotation with attitudes and behaviors of
another person. Hypothesis 2: When individuals believe that their partner has an
elevated heartrate in an uncertain social interaction, they will make negative
assessments about the partner’s trustworthiness (2a), reliability (2b), and
dependability (2c), compared to those who believe that their partner has a
normal heartrate.

*** Methods

To test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey-based vignette experiment.
Vignette studies involve short descriptions of a scenario, designed to elucidate
opinions, attitudes, and beliefs about that particular situation cite:Jenkins2010.

In this vignette study, we compare two different contexts of interaction. We do
not create separate hypotheses for the two different contexts; rather, we are
interested in comparing and contrasting the two different contexts to see how
they might interact with social interpretations of heartrate. We provide our
participants with either an adversarial or a non-adversarial social context. In
the adversarial scenario, the participant is waiting to meet an acquaintance
about a legal dispute. In the non-adversarial scenario, the participant is
waiting at a movie theater for an acquaintance so that they can see a film
together.

In all scenarios, the acquaintance sends a message via smartphone indicating
that he or she is running late due to slow traffic. The person who is waiting
does not know if the acquaintance will make it on time or not, or whether the
acquaintance is being honest about their tardiness. Within each context, we
manipulate a small piece of information about the heartrate of the acquaintance:
We tell the participant that the heartrate of the acquaintance has been shared
by the acquaintances’ smartphone and it is either elevated or normal.

**** Sample

Our sample was undergraduate students recruited from the population of a large,
public university on the West Coast of the U.S. Potential participants were
asked to participate in a short online survey, and they did not know the nature
of the questions or the topic of the study in advance. All participants were
paid a $5 Amazon gift card. One hundred and three participants (103) completed
the experiment survey instrument. The pool was weighted toward women; in our
sample, 65% were women and 34% are male, and 2% (2 subjects) did not identify
with either gender. With random assignment, the same overall gender split was
maintained across conditions. The mean age of participants was 23.

**** Vignettes
Each participant in the study saw only one of the four possible vignettes. After
the vignette, the survey included free response questions about subjects'
reactions to and interpretations of the situation described in the vignette, as
well as 7-point Likert scale questions (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) in
which subjects evaluated the other person's disposition (“This person is
emotional”, “This person is anxious”, “This person is easily upset”, and “This
person is calm”). In addition, we asked participants to indicate whether the
other person was “trustworthy,” “reliable,” and “dependable” using the same 7-
point agreement scale.

There are two contexts of interaction (adversarial and nonadversarial) and two
heartrate conditions (normal and elevated), creating four distinct vignettes
based on social context and heartrate (HR): adversarial elevated HR, adversarial
normal HR, non-adversarial elevated HR, and non-adversarial normal HR.
Participants were randomly assigned into one of the four conditions. We
manipulated these heartrate conditions by making a key wording change as
indicated in the two context vignettes below.

*** Quantitative results

We apply both quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate our research
questions and hypotheses. The study is based around an experimental design, but
we also place significant emphasis on open-ended responses to better understand
participants’ thought processes, beliefs, and rationale for their choices in the
vignettes. Our first hypothesis predicts that individuals will make negative
attributions about the mood of the acquaintance in this uncertain situation when
they believe that the acquaintance has an elevated heartrate (compared to normal
heartrate). Given our four separate measures of mood, we conducted a
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test the hypothesis that there are
one or more mean differences between the normal/elevated heartrate conditions,
and/or between the two contexts of interaction (nonadversarial and adversarial).

We found a strong, statistically significant effect and a medium practical
association between emotional attributions and heartrate condition, F (4, 96) =
32.89, p < .001; partial eta squared = .58. Turning to the individual outcomes,
we find that subjects’ perceptions of the acquaintance in the vignette’s
anxiety, his/her tendency to be easily upset, his/her tendency to be emotional,
and his/her lack of calmness were all significantly higher in the elevated
heartrate conditions when compared to the normal heartrate conditions (see
Figure [[fig:mood-attitude]]). We found no significant effect for the two contexts
of interaction, F (4, 96) = 1.072, p = .38, and no significant effect for the
context x heartrate condition interaction, F (4, 96) = 1.65, p = .17. In sum,
individuals significantly rate acquaintances with elevated heartrate as more
anxious, easily upset, and less calm than those with normal heartrates. In the
non-adversarial context, individuals did not rate the acquaintances as
significantly more emotional in the elevated condition compared to normal, but
this difference was statistically significant in the adversarial context.

The context of interaction (non-adversarial, adversarial) does not have any
effect on mood ratings. With clear statistical and practical significance for
the overall effect of mood attributions by heartrate condition in both contexts
of interaction, Hypothesis 1 is supported.

Our second hypothesis predicts that individuals will make negative assessments
about how certain they are regarding the acquaintances’ trustworthiness
characteristics when the individual has an elevated versus a normal heartrate.
We find a statistically and practically significant effect for the heartrate
conditions, F (3,
97) = 4.19, p < .01; partial eta squared = .12. However, we also
find statistically significant effects for both the context of interaction, F
(3, 97) = 2.82, p < .05, and the context x heartrate condition interaction, F
(3, 97) = 2.75, p < .05.

A closer inspection of the individual mean differences reveals that the means
for all three outcomes (reliability, dependability and trustworthiness) are all
lower in the normal condition compared to the elevated condition in the
adversarial context (see Figure [[fig:trust-attitude]]). This result is the opposite of what
Hypothesis 2 predicts. In the non-adversarial context, we find no statistically
significant differences in trust-related evaluations between heartrate
conditions. Thus, it is the interaction between the context and the heartrate
condition that explains the results: individuals rate acquaintances with normal
heartrates significantly lower in terms of trustworthiness, dependability and
reliability than those with higher heartrates—but only in the adversarial
condition.

Individuals do not rate acquaintances any differently on these three outcomes
between the heartrate conditions within the nonadversarial context. In fact, the
means for these outcomes are very similar across all conditions and contexts,
with the sole exception of the adversarial, normal condition. The mean
differences for the trust-related outcomes between the normal and the elevated
conditions within the adversarial context are all highly statistically
significant (p < .01) and highly practically significant: Cohen’s d = 1.1
(trustworthiness); 1.07 (dependability); 0.68 (reliability). Hypothesis 2 is
therefore not supported. However, the strong findings (statistically and
practically significant) in the opposite direction from our prediction warrant
further exploration in the qualitative results and discussion below.

*** Qualitative results
Directly after the vignette, participants were asked four freeresponse questions
about their reactions to the situation described in the vignette: 1) How do you
react to this message, 2) What makes you react this way, 3) What is the ideal
outcome of this situation, and 4) What is the worst possible outcome of this
situation? The open-field responses were coded into two broad, non-overlapping
categories: those that mentioned a negative emotional reaction to the scenario,
and those that included a mention of what the other person in the situation
might be thinking or feeling. Responses in the latter category were further
sub-divided by experimental condition for analysis.

**** Adversarial Context

This section reports on the qualitative analysis of free responses given by
subjects in the adversarial (legal dispute) context.

***** Normal heartrate


#+NAME: fig:mood-attitude
#+CAPTION: Mood-related evaluation means by condition (bars represent standard deviation).
[[./figures/acmgroup-mood.png]]

#+NAME: fig:trust-attitude
#+CAPTION: Trust-related evaluation means by condition (bars represent standard deviation).
[[./figures/acmgroup-trust.png]]

In the adversarial (legal dispute) context, many subjects who saw a normal
heartrate directly indicated that they were negatively adjusting their appraisal
of the other person, either in their sympathy toward the other person, or in
their judgment of that person’s trustworthiness. We find that normal heartrate
in the adversarial condition appears to be in conflict with the subjects’
expectations about how the acquaintance should feel.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will feel less sympathetic to this person because their heart rate doesn’t
show that they are stressed or upset.

I feel annoyed because a higher heart rate would indicate that the person cares
about the meeting

The normal heartrate implies that my acquaintance isn’t taking this meeting
seriously. However, it is difficult to say that my acquaintance does not care or
is lying. For example, I have no knowledge of the traffic to determine if my
acquaintance is lying.
#+END_QUOTE

Here, participants read a lack of care or concern into the acquaintance’s normal
heartrate, but did not feel the biosignal provided definitive evidence as to
whether or not the acquaintance was being truthful. For some participants,
however, normal heartrate indicated deception:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I would think this person is lying. If they were in a rush, their heartrate
would be faster.

I feel like he is lying and is taking his time. I say "hurry up please I can’t
wait any longer. You are lying to me" It makes me angry to see that his
heartrate is normal through all of this. Mine is spiking out of control.
#+END_QUOTE

These responses could help to explain the surprising quantitative results of
Hypothesis 2 in the adversarial context: the intersection of the adversarial
context with normal heartrate led many participants to view the acquaintance as
unsympathetic and, in some cases, disingenuous. As we see below, these negative
reactions stand in stark contrast to the interpretations in the elevated
heartrate condition.

***** Elevated heartrate

In general, participants in the adversarial context viewed elevated
heartrate as a signal that the acquaintance cared about being late.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Since it shows that the person is trying their best to come, as
shown by the elevated heartrate, I would still feel ok.

I would believe my acquaintance. An elevated heartrate tells me
she is probably rushing/hurrying over. I have data from the phone
to validate what she is saying to a certain extent.
#+END_QUOTE

In these quotes, participants used the elevated heartrate to validate
their acquaintance’s claim, thus positively assessing their honesty.
A few subjects spoke to the power of data in creating what
appeared to be objective facts about the other person.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I won’t be angry because seeing this person’s heart rate being
elevated, it must mean they’re in a hurry. Seeing metrics make it
easier to believe someone.

I feel like I’m in a position of power. With the capacity to check
someone’s heart rate, I can instantly tell how they are feeling. In a
way, it is almost like a lie detector.
#+END_QUOTE

In both of these quotes, we see attitudes about the presumed
authority or “neutrality” of data interacting with beliefs about the
body (namely, the relationship between heartrate and emotion, or
truthfulness), creating a context in which wearables data can be
used to construct social judgments or assessments. How these
assessments play out will vary in different social situations, with
different sensors, and in different contexts of use. Such variations
should be explored much more deeply in future work.

**** Non-Adversarial Context

This section reports on the qualitative analysis of subjects in the
non-adversarial context (meeting for a movie),

***** Normal heartrate

In the non-adversarial context, many participants reported that
normal heartrate conveyed a lack of appropriate social concern:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At first I believe that maybe my acquaintance is running late;
however, when I discover that their heart rate is normal I wonder
why it isn't higher…

It seems like they are too nonchalant about it

I feel frustrated because it seems like the person isn't concerned
about making me wait.
#+END_QUOTE

In these cases, interpretations focused on what the other person
was thinking or feeling. As we saw in the adversarial context,
normal heartrate seems to be in conflict with expectations.
However, unlike in the adversarial context, we did not find
evidence that subjects were re-appraising their trust toward the
other person. Interestingly, two participants read the normal
heartrate positively, as a sign that the other person was telling the
truth.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If his heartrate is normal, then he is probably not lying. I would
still be slightly annoyed at this.

it’s OK. her heartbeat was normal, so no lies
#+END_QUOTE

These subjects seemed to feel annoyed by the partner’s normal heartrate.
However, in contrast to the adversarial context, no subjects explicitly stated
that the other person seemed less trustworthy, honest or reliable as a result.

***** Elevated heartrate
The majority of respondents in the non-adversarial indicated that
the elevated heartrate was a token of the other person’s regret for
being late to the movie. Many participants in this condition
indicated that they would have a more sympathetic reaction to the
text message as a result of seeing an elevated heartrate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Elevated heart rate tells me that the acquaintance at least cares
that he/she is late and there's no point in getting mad.

I would text her back "No problem! I'll grab the tickets and will
wait for you out front." It seems obvious she's in a hurry to get
there, and is late because of traffic.

I will feel apologetic because I can see that this person's heartrate
is elevated and I do no want him/her to feel worried/ stressed
about making a movie.

I would feel anxiety about being late for the movie and pity
because they seem anxious. I don't like being rushed and get
anxious when I am rushed
#+END_QUOTE

In these responses, heartrate generally seemed to signal that the acquaintance
was stressed. While stress is generally assumed to be negative, in this case it
seems to engender identification and empathy with the acquaintance. This example
gestures toward the highly contextual nature of heartrate’s social meaning, and
why more work should examine the consequences of these different
interpretations.

**** Other interpretations of heartrate: Relevance, validity, creepiness

In addition to the major themes noted above, we also found a few
other important interpretations. A small handful of participants 
(12 total) mentioned aspects other than the immediate social
interaction in relation to the shared heartrate display. The points
that surfaced surrounded concerns about privacy, doubts about the
accuracy of the sensing device, and doubts about the relevance of
heartrate to the particular context.

***** Privacy and disclosure concerns

Only three subjects in the entire experiment pool (n=103)
commented on the potential for invasiveness or over-disclosure in
heartrate sharing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(non-adversarial + normal heartrate) ``I feel like I'm violating my
acquaintance's private information by knowing their heart beat.''

(adversarial + normal heartrate) ``I do suspect the person is lying
since his heart rate is normal. I think the extra info of the heart
rate is the reason I have a neg. suggestion towards the person. I
think the reported heart rate is a bad idea.''
#+END_QUOTE

Given that heartrate sharing is not (yet) widely deployed in
consumer devices, it is somewhat surprising that only a few
subjects commented on privacy concerns. This could be partially
explained by the fact that the scenario was imagined, rather that
simulated, and because subjects might have anticipated our
interest in their reactions to the interface.

***** Validity of the device’s data

Four subjects mentioned the possibility that the device, or the
intuitive inferences drawn from it, may be inaccurate.
(adversarial + elevated heartrate) Heart rate could be elevated
for many reasons, and just like studies with lie detectors, it may
possibly indicate lying, but also could indicate other things. It’s
just a number, not a definite answer of lying or not. And even
then, you’ve got to forgive people.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(adversarial + normal heartrate) ``The normal heartrate implies that my
acquaintance isn’t taking this meeting seriously. However, it is difficult to
say that my acquaintance does not care or is lying. For example, I have no
knowledge of the traffic to determine if my acquaintance is lying. Additionally,
my smartphone can be wrong; I don’t know how accurate this technology is,
especially since it is a very new piece of technology.''
#+END_QUOTE

Our study did not reference any existing device, so it is possible that the
fallibility of particular devices was not on subjects’ minds. However, the trust
that people place in sensing devices, and the presumed authority of their data,
should be explored thoroughly in future work.

***** Relevance of heartrate to the social situation

Only two subjects in the study who mentioned heartrate felt that the data
was not necessarily related to the specific social situation described in the
vignette:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(non-adversarial / elevated heartrate) ``My initial reaction would
probably be to ask them if everything is okay. Their heart rate
should probably not be elevated since they are only driving and
weather conditions are not abnormal.''

(adversarial / normal heartrate) ``There may be reasons why
his/her heartrate is normal and why he/she may be late in the first
place, so I'm not concerned about that.''
#+END_QUOTE

Across all conditions, the fact that the vast majority of participants
inferred a causal relationship between the heartrate information
and the particular social situation highlights the relatively reliable
effect of context in priming subjects to draw such inferences. Our
results indicate that simply making the heartrate salient, in the
absence of other cues, invites people to project a causal narrative
on the mood, intentions, and behavior of others.

*** Discussion

We began this investigation by asking how individuals might interpret heartrate
information in uncertain social interactions. Our hypotheses are both based on
the simple rationalization that the kinds of negative attributions that people
tend to make about their own heartrate will be echoed in their social
interpretations of others’ heartrates in uncertain contexts. We found, however,
a much more complex story about the social interpretation of biosignals and the
context of interaction.

Our first hypothesis predicts that an elevated heartrate will be negatively
associated with assessments about mood and dispositions in uncertain social
interactions, both adversarial and non-adversarial. We found strong support for
this hypothesis in both contexts, across our outcome attributions, in line with
prior works’ findings regarding interpretation of one’s own heartrate cite:Young1982. Our
second hypothesis predicts that an elevated heartrate will lead to negative
assessments about the partners’ trustworthiness, dependability and reliability.
As with our first hypothesis, we expected that pre-existing negative
connotations with heartrate might translate into negative expectations of
trustrelated behavior.

We rejected the second hypothesis in both contexts of interaction. In the
non-adversarial context, we found no difference in assessments of
trustworthiness, dependability or reliability in the elevated and normal
heartrate conditions. Furthermore, we found that the average assessments on
these three outcomes were nearly identical between the elevated condition in the
adversarial context and the elevated and normal conditions in the
non-adversarial context.

Most surprisingly, we find a decrease in trustworthiness, dependability, and
reliability in the normal heartrate condition, but only in the adversarial
context. As noted in the quantitative results, the differences between the
elevated and normal conditions in the adversarial context were highly
statistically significant: each of the trust-related measures saw an average
decrease of one full point (on a 7-point scale) in the normal condition compared
to the elevated condition.

To help explain these results, we turn to our qualitative analyses of the
adversarial (legal dispute) context. Subjects in the adversarial context seemed
to have expected their partner to have an elevated heartrate. When the partner
had a normal heartrate, participants viewed it as evidence that s/he is not
bothered enough, not taking the situation seriously, or perhaps even lying.
Indeed, many participants explicitly stated in the open text responses that they
trusted the partner less because his or her heartrate was normal.

Why do we not see the same effect in the non-adversarial context? Turning again
to the qualitative data, we find that participants took elevated heartrate as a
token of their acquaintances’ genuine desire to arrive on time. It seems that
elevated heartrate led many participants in the non-adversarial context to
increase their empathy, identification, and understanding of the partners’
situation. Thus, even though individuals in the non-adversarial condition
associate elevated heartrate with anxiety, lack of calmness, and being easily
upset, the negative emotional interpretations do not seem to translate to
evaluations of one’s trustworthiness, dependability or reliability.

Taken together, we see that heartrate does not inherently (or consistently)
affect trust-related outcomes. Instead, social expectations shape
interpretations of the heartrate biosignal to create highly contextual,
socially-specific meanings. CMC researchers have long noted that, when cues are
omitted from technology-mediated interaction, people tend to fill in the gaps
[3,10]. However, individuals may interpret new types of interpersonal data in
ways we do not yet understand. Our work provides some evidence that such
interpretations might have real social consequences. The fact that heartrate
alone can significantly alter one’s perception of trustworthiness in an
adversarial context is an important step towards the larger goal of unpacking
social interpretations (and their effects) in technologysupported social
interaction. (For one thing, the mostly positive social interpretations of
heartrate observed in past work are likely highly dependent on the social
context in which they were observed).

Finally, we note a diversity of opinions and interpretations within conditions.
For example, a few subjects took normal heartrate as proof of honesty, the
opposite view from the majority of subjects. A few subjects did not feel there
was necessarily any relationship between heartrate and the social situation at
hand. A small minority (three subjects) mentioned concerns around privacy or
disclosure. The wide range of views, sometimes contradictory, highlights the
complexity intrinsic to interfaces that collect and share biosignals, and
warrants future studies into social and contextual interpretation of data from
wearable devices.

*** Limitations

Our vignette experiment examined a single type of scenario in two different
contexts, using text-based answers. We still have a limited picture of the range
of theoretically important contexts in which individuals may observe and
interpret biosignals about others, and a limited understanding of how the rich
cues present in realistic interaction contexts might bare on our findings. Our
study focused on a first-time interaction with an imagined heartrate sharing
interface. We do not know how our findings would hold over time, and it is very
likely that social meanings of any biosignal could become more consistent over
time. The vignette scenario was contrived from believable, but currently
non-existent smartphone technology. Either due to participants’ suspension of
their disbelief or due to their actual attitudes about the heartrate sharing,
few participants raised questions regarding privacy implications of these
scenarios.

Since the vignette study took place online, we could have missed the sorts of
rich contextual cues that might be captured by live interviews or other
in-person methods. Furthermore, the internet presents a wide array of
distractions to survey-takers, and our survey was not able to detect the
participants' attention on the task (e.g.., we could not detect whether the
subject was switching between tabs in their web browser, or taking breaks during
the survey), nor did we monitor how long subjects spent filling out the survey.

While this vignette experiment provides evidence that interpretations of biosignals from sensors
(such as wearables) can affect social attributions and behaviors towards others.
Nevertheless, many questions remain. A controlled, behavioral
experiments could help us ask more specific questions about how elevated
heartrate affects perceptions of risk in uncertain interactions, e.g. when money
is at stake. Such a study could lead to a more robust understanding of how the
transmission of biosignals might affect social behavior. 
Thus, in the following section, we extend this work to a lab-based experiment.

** Lab-based experiment

Following our vignette experiment, which focused on social attitudes, we extend
our inquiry to a trust-building game, which will allow us to study social
behavior. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we find that "elevated"
(versus “normal”) heartrate of an exchange partner is associated with negative
mood attributions and reduced cooperation in a social dilemma game. To
investigate how specific our findings are to heartrate (as opposed to some other
"elevated" signal collected from the body), we replicate our initial experiment
with an unfamiliar biosignal, “skin reflectivity”. We find that both heartrate
and the unfamiliar biosignal are associated with negative mood attributions, but
we observe a decrease in cooperative behavior only with elevated heartrate.
Qualitative results indicate that individuals may learn an association between
our unfamiliar biosignal and the cooperative, trusting behavior of their
partner. Our findings highlight the role prior beliefs can play in shaping
interpretations of a biosignal, while suggesting that designers can, perhaps
inadvertently, train users to associate signals with social meanings. We discuss
implications for how wearable sensors can mediate social interactions.

_TODO remind that we just talked about this in the last exp_
Generally when individuals believe that their heartrate is
elevated, they often believe their mood and emotions to be more negative. Thus,
we apply this same logic to how individuals will interpret the elevated
heartrates of others in uncertain social interactions:

H1. Participants who see a consistently elevated heartrate from their partner
will rate their partner more negatively on mood attributes, compared to
participants who see a consistently normal heartrate in uncertain and risky
social interactions.

If elevated heartrate has a negative connotation with mood, then elevated
heartrate may increase uncertainty about the behavior of one’s partner as well.
When people know that their partner has an elevated heartrate in an uncertain,
risky interactions, they may take actions to protect themselves against
potential losses. In trust-building situations, individuals take small risks
with other people (entrustment behavior) and learn whether the other person
honors that trust or not (cooperative behavior). Thus, individuals have two
different ways to respond to increased uncertainty about their partners’
behavior in trust situations: 1) reduce the amount they entrust to their
partners, or 2) decrease their willingness to cooperate with the partner
cite:Cheshire2010,Cook2005. Since we expect elevated heartrate to have
pre-existing connotations with negative attributes, we predict that individuals
will entrust and/or cooperate less to protect themselves from potential harm
when the partner has an elevated vs. a normal heartrate.

H2. Participants who see an elevated heartrate from their partner will (a) trust
less, and (b) cooperate less with the partner in uncertain and risky social
interactions compared to participants who see a normal heartrate.

*** Study 1: Sharing heartrate in a risky, uncertain interaction

In order to test our hypotheses, we conducted a repeated
trust experiment with shared heartrate information. Trust
games present participants with financial incentives to pay
attention to their partner’s decisions over time, and provide
means for operationalizing trust and cooperation in the
presence of uncertainty cite:Cheshire2010.

The overall design of the trust game involves anonymous
pairs of fixed partners making repeated decisions to entrust
valued resources to the partner, and to return (cooperate) or
keep (defect) the points entrusted by the other partner.
Importantly, individuals can make the highest amount of
money when they entrust many points to a partner and the
partner returns these points. This creates an uncertain social
situation in which participants are trying to earn real money
by repeatedly taking risks (entrusting points) to a partner.
Since the partners are making the same decisions to entrust
and keep/return points from the other partner, these are
mutually-dependent social interactions.

**** Experimental Design and Methods

[[./figures/cscw-hr-monitor.jpg]]

We operationalized an uncertain social interaction situation using a trust game
called the Prisoner’s Dilemma with Dependence (PDD) cite:Cheshire2010,Cook2005.
The PDD game allows individuals to control the amount of risk that they want to
take with their partner by choosing how many points to entrust, followed by a
second decision to either keep or return whatever has been entrusted by their
partner. Thus, the PDD game separates trust behavior (choosing how much to
entrust to a partner) from cooperative behavior (choosing to return or keep what
a partner entrusted). In each round of the PDD game, participants were given an
initial endowment of 10 points. Each participant decided whether to entrust any
number of points to their partner, from zero to ten. Then, participants found
out at the same time whether their partner had entrusted them with any of their
own points, and if so, how many. Next, each participant decided whether to keep
the points entrusted to them (defection) or return them (cooperation). The
participants could not return only a portion of the entrusted points, only all
or none of them. If the points were returned to the partner, they were
automatically doubled in value for that participant.

After all participants made decisions about returning or keeping any points that
had been entrusted to them, they were then asked to place their finger on the
heartrate monitor for a few seconds in order to get a pulse reading (Figure [[fig:hr-monitor]]).
Participants then viewed the summary of point calculations for the round.
Subsequently, participants viewed a visual display of the partners’ recent
heartrate (Figure [[fig:hr-viz]]). The final point calculation for the round included any of
the initial allotment of points remaining after the trust decision, plus and
points that the participant kept from their partner if they decided not to
return them. In addition, players received points for any entrusted points that
their partner returned, which doubled in value.

When participants arrived at the laboratory, they were given a consent form that
described the nature of the study, as well as the human subjects’ approval
information from our university. We wanted participants to believe that they
would be interacting with other real people, and this perception was enhanced by
having 12-16 participants at separate computer terminals in the same large room
during each experimental session. In fact, we controlled the trust and
cooperation behavior of the “partner” for every participant using a simulated
computer actor. As a result, no one in the study interacted with a human
partner.

The simulated actor was programmed to always begin by entrusting one point on
the first round, then randomly entrust up to one point above or below whatever
the partner entrusted on the previous round. In addition, the simulated actor
was programmed to always cooperate (i.e., return the points that were entrusted
by the partner). Following
cite:Cheshire2010,
we chose to use a highly cooperative interaction
partner in order to minimize any other forms of uncertainty in the interaction.
A highly-cooperation partner does not introduce any defection behaviors that
might otherwise reduce cooperation or trust from the participant (thereby
hindering our ability to detect main effects from the experimental
manipulation). Thus, the simulated actor was designed to reciprocate the
entrusting behavior of the human participant on each round, and always cooperate
no matter what the human participant chose to do.

The participants completed 20 rounds of the PDD game, but they did not know how
many rounds they would play in order to eliminate end-game effects. After all
rounds of the PDD game were completed, participants answered a short
post-questionnaire in order to assess their attitudes and beliefs about their
partner. This questionnaire included 7- point Likert-style response questions (1
= strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) about the partners’ beliefs about the
partners’ anxiety (e.g., “my partner is anxious” and “my partner is calm”).

As a manipulation check on the perceptions of the simulated actor’s behavior, we
also asked questions about the partners’ game behavior (“my partner is
trustworthy” and “my partner is cooperative”). Finally, we supplemented our
quantitative measures with two open-ended questions: “How would you describe
your partner?” and “What, if anything, did heartrate tell you about your partner
during this experiment?” Participants were paid between $15-30 based on their
point earnings during the game. The entire study lasted one hour.

#+NAME: fig:hr-viz
#+CAPTION: The heartrate visualization. After viewing the results of the previous round, participants saw a graph of what they believed to be their partner’s heartrate, either normal (left) or elevated (right). Error bars fluctuated within pre-set bounds.
[[./figures/cscw-hr-viz.png]]

At the end of the study, participants were debriefed on the true nature and
intent of the experiment. An experimenter was available at the end of the study
in case of any questions, and we provided participants with the researchers’
email addresses on both the signed informed consent form, as well as the debrief
form, so that they could contact us regarding any aspect of the study. We did
not receive any emails or concerns from participants.

**** Experimental Manipulation

To assess the effect of interacting with a partner who has an
elevated heartrate versus interacting with a partner who has
a normal heartrate, we controlled the heartrate information
that participants saw after each round of the experiment.
This created a two-condition design: always normal
heartrate (NH) and always elevated heartrate (EH).

**** Participants and Procedure

Our sample was undergraduate students recruited from the population of a large
west coast public university in the United States. We contacted potential
participants via email from a voluntary experimental subject pool. All
participants expected to be contacted to participate in a social research study
at some point during the semester, and knew that they would earn between $15-30
during this one-hour study, depending on their choices during the experiment.
Fifty-six participants (56) completed the experiment, 41 women, 14 men, and one
self-identified as other. The mean age of participants was 21.

Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants were guided to an individual desk
with privacy walls. After signing an informed consent form, participants read
written instructions on the computer which explained that they will have the
opportunity to interact with a single partner for many rounds in order to
examine decision making in social situations. Participants were also told that
we would collect pulse (heart rate) information at designated times during the
study using a simple pulse monitor that was connected to the laptop computer.

**** Validity Check of the Visualization

Our study aims to understand the effect of "elevated," as
compared to "normal," heartrate. As such, we needed to
show participants a visualization that afforded only a
relative value for heartrate, not an exact figure (since
different people may have different ideas of what number
value constitutes a normal or elevated heartrate).

We designed a visualization to display a relative heartrate (Figure [[fig:hr-viz]]) and
performed a small (n=25) face validity check to ensure that our visualization
would work as intended in the actual experiment. In our short validity survey,
we included three versions of the visualization, representing a mix of elevated,
low and normal heartrate, and two Likertscale questions: “The precise meaning of
this graphic is ambiguous,” and “I can interpret the difference between ‘low’,
‘normal’, and ‘high’ heartrate from this graphic,” which participants answered
from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” on a 5-point scale. We also
included two open-ended questions, “Please explain what the picture is telling
you about one's heartrate,” and “Please explain what this picture does not tell
you about one's heartrate.”

We distributed this survey over an email list to students and alumni of a
public, West Coast US university, and received 25 valid responses. The answers
to both Likert questions indicated agreement that the visualization was both
ambiguous (mean = 3.58, S.D. = 1.28) and also easily interpretable (mean = 3.41,
S.D. = 1.35). Importantly, openended qualitative responses confirmed that the
heartrate was easily understandable, but that the precise value of heartrate was
ambiguous.

*** Study 1: Results
**** Quantitative results

#+NAME: fig:cscw-study1
#+CAPTION: Means of entrustment and cooperation (left) and mood attributions (right) in elevated and normal heartrate conditions.
[[./figures/cscw-Study1.png]]

Our first hypothesis predicts that, when individuals believe that their partner
has a consistently elevated heartrate, compared to a normal heartrate, they will
rate the partner more negatively on mood attributes. Consistent with prior
research, we found an overall strong, statistically significant effect and
medium practical association between attributions and experimental condition,
F(4, 51) = 6.7, p < .0001; Wilk’s lambda = .66, partial eta squared =.34.
Turning to the individual outcomes, we find that perceptions of the partners'
anxiety is significantly higher in the EH condition (M = 3.86, SD = 1.72)
compared to the NH condition (M = 2.14, SD = 1.27), F(1, 54) = 18, p < .001;
partial eta squared = .25. Furthermore, participants rated their partners as
significantly more calm in the NH condition (M = 5.9, SD = 1.3) compared to the
EH condition (M = 4.29, SD = 1.46), F(1, 54) = 18.71 p < .001; partial eta
squared =.26. On the other hand, we found no statistically significant
differences for perception that the partner is “easily upset” or that the
partner is “emotional” (p = n.s.). In sum, we find strong statistical and
practical differences in perceptions of both anxiety and calmness, but no
statistical or practical differences in perceptions of how emotional or easily
upset the partner is in the two experimental conditions. Given the significant
omnibus test and significant results on two of the four individual outcomes,
Hypothesis 1 is partially supported.

Our second set of hypotheses predict that participants in the elevated heartrate
(EH) condition will exhibit lower trusting (H2a) and/or cooperative (H2b)
behavior compared to those in the normal heartrate (NH) condition. The average
points entrusted by participants in the EH condition (M = 7.88, SD = 2.18) was
not significantly different than the NH condition (M = 7.7, SD = 2.18), t =.28,
p=n.s, one-tailed test. Thus, individuals entrusted points to their partners at
approximately the same level in both conditions (Figure [[fig:cscw-study1]]). Hypothesis 2a is not
supported.

However, we found that the average cooperation rate in the EH condition (M =
.74, SD = .37) was statistically significantly lower than the NH condition (M =
.89, SD = .25), t = 1.76, p < .05, one-tailed test. Importantly, this result
shows a medium practical effect size (Cohen’s d = .47), indicating a meaningful
real world difference. On average, those in the normal heartrate condition
cooperated 20% more than those in the elevated heartrate condition (Figure [[fig:cscw-study1]]).
Hypothesis 2b is supported.

***** Manipulation Checks

Since we designed the simulated actors in both conditions with trusting and
always-cooperative behavior, we did not expect participants to rate the
simulated actors differently in terms of the focal behaviors of cooperativeness
and trustworthiness between experimental conditions. This is a critical
manipulation check, since we need to rule out any perceived effect of the
simulated partners' behavior in order to establish that the primary treatment
(heartrate of partner) had an effect on the human participants' behavior. The
omnibus test of difference in perceptions of the trustworthiness and cooperative
behavior between conditions was not significant, F(2, 53) = .21, p = n.s.;
Wilk’s lambda = .99, partial eta squared =.01. Thus, as we would expect,
individuals did not indicate significant behavioral differences for the
trusting, cooperative simulated actor (which was programmed to behave exactly
the same in both conditions).

**** Qualitative results

At the end of our questionnaire, before the demographic questions and the
debriefing, participants were presented with two open-ended questions. The first
asked participants to “Tell us how you would describe your partner.” The second
asked participants “What, if anything, did heartrate tell you about your partner
during this experiment?” This section discusses and unpacks some of the
responses that these questions elicited.

***** Elevated Heartrate

Many people who referred to elevated heartrate in their responses mentioned that
it signaled anxiety. In some cases, participants even reflected on a negative
relationship between elevated heartrate, anxiety and trust:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
how excited he/she is, whether he/she cheated

It was elevated all the time so I think s/he was anxious [...]
so I guess s/he did not completely trust me
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes further support our first hypothesis, as well as
findings of past work showing that elevated heartrate
typically signals anxiety and mood. In other words, elevated
heartrate (and heartrate in general) seemed to be about the
partner's current disposition, rather than who the partner
was as a person. While the majority of those who mentioned
elevated heartrate implied a causal relationship between the
signal and the game context, a few did not:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My partner's heart rate was elevated the whole time, most
students are stressed so that might be why.

They may have been nervous because of doing the
experiment itself.
#+END_QUOTE

The relative rarity of skepticism about the relationship
between heartrate and specific game events highlights the
crucial role of framing and salience in turning what might
be a disembodied signal (heartrate data) into a relevant,
contextual clue. We also noted diversity in beliefs about the
meaning of heartrate itself. Where almost all participants
who mentioned heartrate associated it with anxiety, at least
one participant had an entirely different take on his/her
partner's consistently elevated heartrate:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My partner's heart rate does not change too much which
indicates that he or she is very nice.
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes highlight overall diversity in what an elevated
heartrate is capable of meaning. Even within our relatively
small, and relatively homogenous sample of university
students, our quotes imply a mostly negative association
with elevated heartrate, but also a potentially long tail of
diverse beliefs about elevated heartrate.

***** Normal Heartrate

Many participants said that normal heartrate indicated that
the partner was "calm," "chilled out," or "not anxious."
[HR signaled] that my partner was always calm. The heart
rate never fluctuated, it didn't make a difference.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
They remained calm

I think it showed that my partner wasn't too nervous to see
if he/she was returned the points or not, maybe because it
was just an experiment or maybe because he/she wasn't
worried about what result he/she was about to see was. 
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes show subjects inferring a direct connection
between the heartrate signal and the attribution of a calm
mood. One participant specifically mentioned that
consistency of normal heartrate made their partner seem
more trustworthy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My partner's heart rate has been consistently normal
throughout the experiment, so I guess s/he has no intention
to cheat.
#+END_QUOTE

Another participant, presumably a cooperative one, thought
that their partner’s heartrate would have risen if s/he had not
cooperated:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think it remained the same [normal] because I paralleled
my partner's actions whereas if I had contradicted them,
their heartrate probably would have changed in response.
#+END_QUOTE

In all of the above quotes (and the vast majority of
responses), participants inferred a relationship between
normal heartrate and calmness. However, a few participants
did not infer any relationships between behavior, moods
and the signal they saw.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Heartrate did not tell me anything. My partner was average
each time. I also am sure I have an elevated heart rate due
to coffee consumption so I did not take my partners into
consideration.

I based my decisions on their previous actions.
#+END_QUOTE

Not every participant explicitly inferred a calm mood from
the normal heartrate signal, but most did. Taken alongside
our quantitative results, our qualitative results provide
evidence that subjects have used the emotional attributions
they made based on their partner’s normal heartrate to guide
their behavior in the trust game.

*** Study 2: Sharing an unknown signal in a risky, uncertain interaction

In study 1, we found that participants cooperate less with partners who have
elevated heartrates in the repeated trust game, compared to those with normal
heartrates. While this result supports one of our key hypotheses, it also begs
another question: Is the effect we observe due to heartrate specifically, or
might any elevated biosignal show the same results for negative perceptions of
mood and reduced cooperative behavior towards the partner?

In our second experiment, we attempt to tease out the effect of the heartrate
signal itself, compared to any “elevated” (versus “normal”) signal collected
from the body. We replicate the first study, except that we tell participants
that our monitor device measures SRI (Skin Reflectivity Index). SRI is an
unfamiliar biosignal, for which individuals should not have any prior cultural
or social beliefs.

**** Hypotheses

Without any context for what SRI means as a signal,
participants may assume that any biological signal that is
“elevated” from normal will be negatively associated with
one’s mood. If this is the case, then we should observe the
same general pattern of negative mood attributions and less
cooperative behavior when the partner has an elevated SRI
as we observed with heartrate.

On the other hand, perhaps heartrate is special due to its
common social associations with mood, anxiety, and even
deception. If heartrate is distinctive in this regard, then we
would not observe the same significant differences between
normal and elevated SRI and mood attributes, trust, and
cooperation rates with the partner.

To test the effect of our unfamiliar biosignal on behavior in
risky, uncertain interactions, we evaluate the exact same
hypotheses from study 1 again in the context of SRI:
H3. Participants who see a consistently elevated SRI from
their partner will rate their partner more negatively on
mood attributes, compared to participants who see a
consistently normal SRI in uncertain and risky social
interactions.

H4. Participants who see an elevated SRI will have lower
(a) trust rates (b) cooperation rates in uncertain and risky
social interactions compared to participants who see a
normal SRI.

**** Experimental Design and Methods

The second study was identical to the heartrate study in
every way, except that we told participants we were
measuring "Skin Reflectivity Index," instead of heartrate.
All mentions of the word "heartrate" in our original
experiment software were replaced with "SRI" and/or "Skin
Reflectivity Index”. We purposely did not define or explain
what the SRI signal is, or what its measurements mean. All
participants were debriefed on the true nature of the
experiment at the conclusion of the study. This debriefing
included the fact that the partner was based on idealized
behavior, and “SRI” was actually just a term for heartrate,
as collected by a standard light-based pulse sensor. As with
the first study, participants had the ability to ask the
experimenter questions at the end of the study, or send an
email if they had additional questions or concerns. We did
not receive any follow-up concerns from participants.
The only other variation from the first experiment is that, in
the SRI experiment, we told participants to place their
palms an inch above the light sensor rather than to place
their fingers on the monitor. Since placing a finger on a light
sensor is a familiar of measuring heartrate, this was done to
reduce the possibility that participants would think that SRI
is actually heartrate.

**** Participants

We recruited our sample for the second study from the same
population and using the same method as described in study
1. Our recruitment procedures ensured that no one who
participated in the first study could be recruited for the
second study. Sixty-three participants (63) completed the
second experiment, 40 women, 22 men, and one selfidentified
as ‘other’. The mean age of participants was 21.
Importantly, the gender distribution and age of the sample
was equivalent to the first study.

*** Study 2: Results

**** Quantitative results

#+NAME: fig:cscw-study2
#+CAPTION: Means of entrustment and cooperation (left) and mood attributions (right) in elevated and normal SRI conditions.
[[./figures/cscw-Study2.png]]

H3 predicts that when individuals believe that their partner has a consistently
elevated SRI, compared to a normal SRI, they will rate the partner more
negatively on mood attributes. As with the first study on heartrate, we found an
overall strong, statistically significant effect and medium practical
association between attributions and experimental condition, F(4, 59) = 4, p <
.01; Wilk’s lambda = .79, partial eta squared =.21. For the individual outcomes,
we find that perceptions of the partners' anxiety is significantly higher in the
elevated SRI condition (M = 3.97, SD = 1.62) compared to the normal SRI
condition (M = 2.67, SD = 1.24), F(1, 62) = 12.8, p < .001; partial eta squared
= .17. Furthermore, participants rated their partners as significantly more calm
in the normal SRI condition (M = 5.5, SD = 1.3) compared to the elevated SRI
condition (M = 4.68, SD = 1.63), F(1,
62) = 4.4 p < .05; partial eta squared =.07. Just as with the
heartrate study, we found no statistically significant differences for
perception that the partner is ‘easily upset’ or that the partner is ‘emotional’
(p = n.s.). In sum, we find strong statistical and practical differences in
perceptions of both anxiety and calmness, but no statistical or practical
differences in how emotional or easily upset one perceives the partner to be in
SRI conditions. Given the significant omnibus test and significant results on
two of the 4 individual outcomes, Hypothesis 3 is partially supported.

Our final hypotheses predict that participants in the elevated SRI condition
will exhibit lower trusting (H4a) and cooperative (H4b) behavior compared to
those in the normal SRI condition. The average points entrusted by participants
in the elevated SRI condition (M = 8.5, SD = 1.27) was not significantly
different than the normal SRI condition (M = 8.7, SD = 1.77), t =.39, p = n.s,
one-tailed test. Thus, individuals entrusted points to their partners at
approximately the same level in both conditions (Figure [[fig:cscw-study2]]). Unlike the heartrate
study, however, we found no significant difference in cooperation rate between
in the elevated SRI (M = .89, SD = .21) and the normal SRI condition (M = .88,
SD = .25), t = .09, p = n.s., one-tailed test. H4a and H4b are not supported.

***** Manipulation Checks

As with the first study, the simulated actors in study 2 were programmed to be
consistently trusting and cooperative in the elevated and normal SRI conditions.
Thus, we do not expect participants to rate the simulated actors differently in
terms cooperativeness and trustworthiness between experimental conditions. As
expected, the omnibus test of difference in perceptions of the trustworthiness
and cooperative behavior between conditions was not significant, F(2, 61) = 3, p
= n.s.; Wilk’s lambda = .91, partial eta squared =.09.

**** Qualitative results

As in the heartrate condition, participants in the SRI condition were asked
open-ended questions at the end of the post-experiment questionnaire, before the
demographic questions and debrief. As in the heartrate condition, participants
were asked how they would describe their partner. However, unlike in the
heartrate condition, participants were asked, "Recall what we were measuring
with the sensor. Please describe it below." After completing this question,
participants proceeded were given two more open-ended items: "What, if anything,
did SRI (skin reflectivity) tell you about your partner during this experiment?"
and, "As a signal, what do you believe that SRI says about another person?"

***** The Meaning of an Unfamiliar Biosignal

We purposely did not explain what SRI might mean in this study. Nevertheless,
when asked what was being measured in SRI, some participants gave us thorough
explanations: The "reflectivity" part of SRI leads me to believe that the device
is measuring how much light is reflected by a person's palms, which leads me to
assume that SRI is increased when a person's hands are sweatier, and thus more
covered in water, which reflects light better than simply someone's skin.

While explanations like this one indicate that participants believed our signal
was real, reports of what participants thought SRI meant in the context of the
game are more relevant to our analysis here. Like in the elevated heartrate
conditions, and elevated SRIs were associated with either nervousness or
excitement.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the SRI reads high, it may indicate that the person expects to be betrayed in
some way or is hopeful of a positive result. I forgot what SRI stands for again.
Since his/her SRI is always elevated, I would assume he/she is nervous/excited
or just it's hot in here.

SRI may give insight as to how nervous or excited someone's response is to
something that happens. Maybe someone with a larger range in SRI is more
emotional. 
#+END_QUOTE


These assessments of SRI are quite similar to interpretations from
the elevated heartrate, and corroborate our quantitative findings that those who
saw elevated SRI rate their partners as more nervous. However, the fact that
these emotional assessments were similar in both elevated heartrate and elevated
SRI conditions, but behavioral outcomes were different, challenges our notion
that negative emotional cues caused these behavioral outcomes—a point we address
in more detail in the discussion below. As in the heartrate conditions, some
participants responded that SRI told them little or nothing of interest about
their partner: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Nothing at all about the person other than an arbitrary value of
a sensor.


Since the SRI seemed to be bouncing around in the blue
range but never got into the red range (which I assume
would be "abnormal" since the blue range was normal) I
don't think SRI is an accurate measurement of much.
As with heartrate, people cannot always be convinced that
a biosignal is informative, even after many rounds of
conditioning and a highly suggestive context. However, as
in the heartrate condition, responses indicating that SRI had
no meaning were a clear minority in our sample.
#+END_QUOTE


***** Elevated SRI

To help explain why elevated heartrate had a chilling effect on cooperative
behavior, where elevated SRI did not, we delve into the responses of
participants in the elevated SRI condition. When asked what SRI told them about
their partner, participants often reported nervousness or anxiety, just as we
noted in the quantitative results:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[SRI shows] stress or heightened anxiety

how reactive they are, or how close to the surface their
emotions are.

The nervousness of a person.
#+END_QUOTE

However, we noted that a significant number of participants
in this condition mentioned that elevated SRI had some sort
of positive association with behavior—even though it is also
interpreted as indicating anxiety.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Elevated means they feel safe and trustful. Lower than
average means they are defensive and scared.
#+END_QUOTE

This interpretation stands in stark contrast to elevated
heartrate, which also signaled anxiety, but had a negative
association with behavior. In explaining why participants
found elevated SRI to signal cooperativeness and trust, we
look toward the responses of participants who seemed to
learn a meaning for this signal:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Well, since their SRI was always high and they always gave
the money back to me, (based on these only two bits of info
I know) I assume the two are correlated and an elevated SRI
means that they're going to give the money back. [...] I guess
it means that they're trustworthy and will do the right thing
by their partner.

I cannot tell [what SRI means], but my partner's was
extremely elevated for the whole experiment and s/he was
good at conducting mutually beneficial transactions.
#+END_QUOTE

These quotes strongly suggest that, unlike for heartrate, SRI
participants picked up on a pattern between their partner's
always-cooperative behavior and the elevated biosignal that
we displayed to them, thus filling in the gaps about what
SRI meant in this context. In contrast, we found no evidence
that elevated heartrate participants learned such an
association in the first study, despite the fact that every
participant interacted with a perfectly cooperative partner in
all conditions and studies.

***** Normal SRI

As with those in the elevated SRI condition, many participants in the normal SRI
condition identified some relationship between SRI and the other person’s mood.
I think this helps identify how people are feeling internally when making
decisions.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
his/her mood at that point of time

[SRI shows] stress or heightened anxiety

how anxious they are.

I think our anxiety is being measured.

How anxious/nervous someone is, if their SRI is high
#+END_QUOTE

In some cases, participants in the normal SRI condition inferred that elevated
SRI might have a negative meaning: not to sure, high sri may indicate panic/fear
or anger low sri may indicate calmness and contentness. A person is less likely
to trust other people if he or she has a high SRI.

Overall, the responses for both SRI conditions support the interpretation that
participants learned an association between cooperative, trustworthy behavior
from the partner and SRI. As we argue in the following discussion, such
associations are more likely in the SRI conditions because, unlike for
heartrate, participants should have no preexisting beliefs or associations with
SRI.


*** Limitations

Controlled, laboratory studies always come with clear advantages (such as high
internal validity) and disadvantages (such as reduced external and ecological
validity). Our study did not attempt to emulate a real-world interaction context
with a biometric sharing device, though this is a clear next step, now that we
know there are important differences in how biosignals are interpreted.
Furthermore, our use of highly cooperative, computercontrolled interaction
partners with stable biosignals (always high or always normal), prevents us from
being able to speak to the effects of more dynamic behaviors and/or changes in
biosignals over longer periods of time. From these experiments, we also do not
know how these results will transfer to other contexts, and other types of
social interactions. Also, our study by nature focused on first-time, iterated
interactions, both with an interface and with another unknown person. We do not
know how these results might apply over the course of more personal
relationships, or after repeated experiences with a specific interface in a
biosignal sharing device. In addition, this research was conducted on young
adults at a large public university, which is an important limitation when
considering whether these results would hold across age groups and other key
sources of sociodemographic variation in the larger population.

** Discussion

We found that both heartrate and SRI signaled negative mood to participants,
including anxiety and lack of calmness. It is possible that almost any
“elevated” biosignals could be associated with negative mood attributions such
as anxiety and lack of calmness: many elevated signals (pulse, temperature,
blood pressure) carry associations with being angry, sick, hot-headed, and a
host of other negative attributions. People may default to such attributions
when seeing an unknown signal that comes from the body.

Elevated heartrate had a chilling effect on cooperation, where an unfamiliar
biosignal, SRI, did not. So, why did the negative mood attributions in the
elevated SRI condition not translate into reduced cooperation, as they did for
elevated heartrate?

Our results shed light on two relevant phenomena that may address this question.
First, pre-existing beliefs about heartrate are powerful: even when playing with
a very cooperative, trusting game partner, negative connotations surrounding
elevated heartrate appear to lead individuals to cooperate less. Our results
suggest that participants bring to uncertain social interactions their own
expectations about what elevated heartrate means, and that these biases cannot
be quickly overridden, even when behavioral evidence sends a positive message
(e.g., high cooperation and trust from the partner).

Second, we find evidence that participants can “learn” a social meaning for a
previously unknown signal. Our qualitative data suggest that participants in the
SRI condition associated whichever signal they saw (elevated or normal) with
cooperativeness, and trustworthiness. Unlike with heartrate, people did not have
preconceived notions of how SRI should affect the social behavior of the
partner, since SRI does not exist. Instead, we observe participants discovering
"what SRI means" by watching their partner's behavior in relation to the
biosignal. In the absence of guidelines for interpreting what SRI is or what it
measures, individuals appear to fill in the gaps with available behavioral
information.

If people can learn social meanings for previously unknown signals, perhaps even
pre-existing connotations for familiar biosignals could change over time. After
all, the meanings of a signal like heartrate are the product of associations
that have been shared and developed over centuries. However, technology allows
for new expressions of these ancient signals cite:Slovak2012.
If social heartrate
information became an easily accessible biosignal in trust-based interactions
like negotiations, we might find its social meaning could evolve further.
Unfortunately, short-term laboratory studies such as this one are unlikely to
trigger or detect enduring shifts in the social meanings of familiar biosignals.
We need both longer-term experiments, and mixed-methods research that can draw
from rich qualitative data as well as statistically and practically significant
changes in interpretations over time.

Broadly, our results raise questions about how and why unfamiliar signals take
on social meanings in different contexts of interaction. Researchers in CSCW and
HCI have long noted our tendency to read into cues and signals in
technology-mediated communications. From impact factors and citation counts in
scholarly work cite:Elsden2016a to societal indices cite:Wilson2003 , to health
metrics such as the bodymass index (BMI) cite:Campos2004, human have a tendency
to impart “real” meanings onto metrics, scales and signals – meanings that may
not align with the concepts their designers aimed to measure. It is critical
that we continue to question how biosignal data could shape our interpersonal
interactions, and whether the outcomes will always translate into meaningful
social information.

** Implications for design

From research projects like the sociometer, which produce “social metrics”
cite:Wu2008,
to consumer devices like the Spire, which compute "calmness" or "focus"
quotients cite:SpireInc,
developers are throwing different biometric signals at people
faster than they can learn what the signals mean in context. In the absence of
strong cultural beliefs about the signal, people could produce correlative
assumptions similar to the ones we observed in our experiment. Designers should
take care to establish what the signals in the applications mean, or could mean.
Testing the limits of what people are willing, or able, to believe, and whether
these beliefs transfer between different contexts, could have wide-reaching
implications for those who design interactions with wearable biosensors.

On the other hand, many research and commercial projects use signals that people
might associate with commonly understood experiences (e.g. a racing heart, a
sweaty palm). Designers should strongly consider how these embodied experiences
might color the conclusions that users jump to, and bound what users are willing
to believe. 

We also hope that researchers will investigate settings in which biosignals vary
over longer time periods, perhaps with a more naturalistic technology probe
study. Such a study could help us understand how prior beliefs about signals
both affect and are affected by social interactions in the course of everyday
life.

In general, wearable sensors can enable social interactions in which we share
more information than is normally possible face-to-face. The ability to surface
signals that are normally socially invisible (e.g. heartrate, or galvanic skin
response) presents new territory for designers of computermediated interactions.
While recent work has explored how these novel signals fit into our existing
understanding of social cues cite:Howell2016, much work remains. 

** Conclusion

We find that sharing heartrate can negatively influence trusting attitudes and
behaviors. However, heartrate alone does not communicate trust. Instead,
individual’s social expectations interact with the heartrate data to produce
context-specific meanings. Complicating matters further, our qualitative data
reveal a diversity of interpretations regarding the relevance and meaning of a
heartrate in context, and the privacy implications of biosensing technologies.
Our findings advance and complicate our understanding of the role that biosignal
sharing can play in social, computer-mediated contexts, and motivate more
detailed study into the mechanisms by which social interpretations arise from
basic physiological signals.

Further, our experimental results imply that interfaces can “teach” the meaning of some
biosignals, where others carry strong, pre-existing connotations that even
repeated interactions cannot easily alter. In general, prior beliefs about the
body (drawn from culture, lived experience) seem to shape what a biosignal can
mean in a given context. However, in the absence of prior beliefs, there exists
an opportunity—and a potential danger—that designers of biosignal-sharing
systems can condition participants to learn (potentially arbitrary) associations
between biosignals and social behaviors.

Aside from heartrate, we do not know what many other biosignals might be
associated with moods and behaviors. Other biosignals (e.g., galvanic skin
response, electroencephalography or EEG), could offer different affordances for
sense-making. It is unclear from our work how the social interpretation of the
signals from these devices could affect social behaviors such as dyadic and
group trust. Similar studies with signals from, e.g., the brain cite:Ali2014a
are a clear direction for future work. Especially interesting cases are signals
for which precise or empirical meanings are still being hotly debated, such as
EEG (brainwaves), a sensing modality we begin to discuss in the following chapter.
* TODO Shifting to the brain

While the prior chapter establishes that people build mind-related meanings
around biosensory data, this chapter locates brainscanning, and brain-based
authentication specifically, as a fruitful case for understanding how particular
sensing technologies construct notions of mind. I report on the qualitative and
quantitative results of survey among participants in a large (n>10,000),
longitudinal health study, and an Amazon Mechanical Turk population.

** TODO Introduction
*** TODO Last study looked deeply into heartrate
*** TODO Now time to look at all the diff sensing modalities
** TODO Methods

The survey we report on here, currently in-progress, examines how people's
beliefs differ given device ownership, and their membership in one of two
groups: Mechanical Turk workers, or people enrolled in Health-e-Heart, a massive
(n > 40,000), longitudinal study, in which volunteers fill out surveys about
themselves, and/or upload data from biomedical self-tracking devices, over the
course of several years cite:Estrin2010a. 

*** TODO Motivation behind subject choice

**** TODO why heh?

**** TODO why mturk?

*** Subjects / Survey
In one portion of the survey, we ask
subjects to rate a number of different biosensors in order of how likely
individual's believe each sensor is to reveal what ``a person is thinking or
feeling'' (Figure [[fig:sensor-rank]]). This section reports on a subset of
Mechanical Turk workers (n=100) and Health-e-Hearth subjects (n=100).

** TODO Quantiative results

In our preliminary findings, brainwaves (EEG) are seen as among the most
revealing biosignals, just below body language and facial expression, in their
capacity to reveal the inner workings of a person's mind. More common sensors
such as GPS and step count are seen as less revealing (despite empirical
evidence suggesting such data can be quite revealing indeed cite:Canzian2015).

#+ATTR_LATEX: :float multicolumn
#+NAME: fig:sensor-rank
#+caption: ``Please rank the following sensors in how likely you believe they are to reveal what a person is thinking and feeling.'' Higher bars indicate higher rank, or higher likelihood of being revealing.
[[./figures/rankings.png]]

** TODO Qualitative results

Our qualitative data revealed that subjects in both groups generally believed EEG to reveal various details about the mind, mood, emotions, and identity.
We asked subjects to reflect on why they answered the way they did during the ranking task (Figure \ref{fig:rank}).
In the Health-e-Heart group, several subjects gave relatively specific explanations as to why they ranked EEG hihgly.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S24) I assume some information can be gleaned from brain wave activity in various parts of the brain related to rewards or executive control, but without accompanying information, it may be difficult to discover my thoughts./

/(S23) EEGs note parts of the brain that are active.  Again, in conjunction with other measurements, I suspect that some sense of what one is thinking and feeling could be learned./

/(S91) I would rate this relatively high on the list because science has shown that we can detect a lot about which areas of the brain are accessed and at which times.  This can tell a person a lot about what they might be thinking and especially how they are feeling./
#+END_QUOTE

While these explanations range somewhat in their specificity and confidence,
they share the general sentiment that EEGs can be revealing. Subjects in the Mechanical Turk condition broadly shared this belief, though tended to use less physiological detail in their explanations.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S157) Brain activity can pinpoint exact emotions by monitoring certain areas on the brain./

/(S130) Brainwaves could tell you a lot more about what someone is thinking and feeling. You could measure the patterns of brainwaves in an experiment./
#+END_QUOTE

Meanwhile, some subjects from both groups did not fit this trend. Ten subjects ranked EEG low in its ability to measure what a person is thinking or feeling. Their qualitative answers revealed a diverse set of reasons for this ranking.
Three subjects indicated a general lack of faith in brainwave's reliabilty.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S20) I don't think we have the ability to translate brainwaves into thoughts or emotions./

/(S101) EEG is very nonspecific and rarely can tell details reliably./

/(S138) Possible but not accurate./
#+END_QUOTE

These explanations broadly centered around EEG as a signal.
They range somewhat in their confidence, from a fundamental skepticism (S20) to caveats about possible accuracy or specificity (S101, S138).
In contrast to these three subjects, S10 ranked EEG low because s/he
felt the premise of a consumer grade EEG was implausible.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S10) I assume that scientists can identify by brain patterns what others are feeling and thinking based off of years of research.  I've never heard of a consumer grade eeg - and doubt it could be as powerful as a laboratory eeg.  If it is then I would be interested in this product./
#+END_QUOTE

This subject's explanation surfaces the practical differences in attitudes that people might have to a technology's theoretical existence,
and its realized existence as a consumer device. Future work could look more closely at 
how the presumed scientific authority of a brainscanning apparatus affects people's willingness to accept specific BCI applications such as passthoughts cite:Ali2014a.
Finally, one subject's skepticism what brainwaves can reveal stemmed from his/her personal medical experiences.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/(S116) My son has absence seizures, so his brainwaves change./
#+END_QUOTE

This quote highlights how individuals' life experiences
might shape the way they engage (or refuse to engage) with brain-sensing devices.
In general, this quote and others motivate the need for a rich, qualitative understanding of people's first-hand experiences with brainscanning devices,
as well as data collection,
in order to understand what role BCI applications such as passthoughts could play in day-to-day life.

** Brain-based authentication as a usecase

*** TODO Motivating a brain-based probe

**** TODO Why brains interesting case given data

**** TODO Wonder aloud how to study brain-based case, lay out specs

*** Brain-based authentiation

**** Authentication

Authentication seeks to prove that a user is who they claim to be. In computer
security, authenticators are classified into three types: knowledge factors
(e.g., passwords and PINs), possession factors (e.g., physical tokens, ATM
cards), and inherence factors (e.g., fingerprints and other biometrics).
Passwords, which rely only on a knowledge factor, offer many benefits
cite:Bonneau2012, including their capability for allowing /authorization/
(granting use of a system). However, for authentication (verifying an
individual), passwords are easy to compromise, and easy to forget. These
shortcomings motivate the overlay of multiple factors of authentication.

**** Multi-factor authentication

An ongoing problem in authentication lies in balancing strong security (i.e.,
multiple factors) with usability. As an example, major industry players such as
Google and Facebook have strongly encouraged their users to adopt two-factor
authentication (2FA), in which a user enters his or her password (a knowledge
factor), and subsequently receives a code on their cellphone (a posession
factor).

However, submitting two different authenticators in two separate steps has
frustrated wide adoption due to its additional hassle to users. The Apple
iPhone, for instance, already supports device unlock using either a
user-selected passcode or a fingerprint. The device could very well support a
two-step two-factor authentication scheme if desired. However, it is easy to
understand why users would balk at having to enter a passcode /and/ provide a
fingerprint each time they want to unlock their phone.

**** One-step, multi-factor authentication

Since passthoughts' initial proposal in 2005, more ubiquitous sensing and
computing has enabled a number of other strategies for achieving two factors of
authentication in a single step. Some work has tested behavioral authentication
methods such as keystroke dynamics, or voice. In both cases, the knowledge
factor (password or passphrase) and inherence factor (typing rhythm or speaker's
voice) are employed cite:Monrose1997. In contrast, the Nymi band supports
one-step two-factor authentication via the inherence factor (cardiac rhythm that
is supposed to be unique to each individual) and the possession factor (the
wearing of the band on the wrist) cite:Nymi. More recent attempts have also used
gait (from cellphone accelorometers) to perform authentication cite:UnifyID2017.
# Custom-built EEG devices could incorporate an added possession factor 
# to the already two-step authentication provided by passthoughts cite:Curran2017.

However, these existing strategies are susceptible to a variety of attacks.
Nymi, for example, does not have a knowledge factor, making it impossible for
the user to change the authentication token if the device and biosignal have
been compromised. Keystroke dynamics, voice, and gait are all susceptable to
``shoulder surfing,'' in which an attack uses visual or other cues to steal, or
improve the chances of guessing, a target's chosen secret. Passthoughts
mitigates this attack by nature of the mental gesture. Since the expression of a
passthought is not externally visible, the authenticator is impervious to
shoulder surfing attacks. Since the thought incorporates a chosen secret
(knowledge factor), it can be changed if compromised.

To assist with the usability and security issues surrounding multi-factor
authentication, passthoughts aims to provide two factors of authentication in a
single step. A single mental task, or passthought, provides both a knowledge
factor (a chosen secret thought) with an inherence factor (the way that thought
is expressed for an individual) cite:Chuang2013b,Johnson2014. Using a custom
sensing device, passthoughts could provide an additional posession factor, all
in the same step.

The use of EEG as a biometric signal for user authentication has a short
history. In 2005, Thorpe et al. motivated and outlined the design of a
passthoughts system cite:Thorpe2005. Since 2002, a number of independent groups
have achieved low (less than 1%) false acceptance rates using multi-channel
sensors placed on the scalp
cite:Poulos2002,Marcel2007a,Palaniappan2008,Ashby2011. In 2013, one group showed
that similar accuracy can also be achieved using a consumer-grade single-channel
sensor cite:Chuang2013b. In particular, the lack of signal diversity from
multiple EEG channels can be overcome by allowing the users to choose their own
personalized passthoughts (e.g., sing their favorite song in their head). There
are two significant consequences of this result. First, the passthoughts
approach is no longer constrained by the high cost (> $10,000 USD) and low
usability (gel-based electrodes; aesthetic challenges of an EEG cap) of
medical-grade multi-channel devices. Second, because users can choose and easily
change their secret mental task, this approach can support one-step two- factor
authentication via the simultaneous presentation of the inherence factor
(brainwave signatures due to the unique folding structures of the cortex) and
the knowledge factor (the secret mental task) cite:Chuang2014.

* Talking to engineers about brain-computer interface
# Utopia
In 2017, both Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk announced 
efforts to build a brain-computer interface (BCI) cite:Levy2017.
One blog post enthusiastically describes Musk's planned 
BCI as a ``wizard hat,'' which will transform human
society by creating a ``worldwide supercortex,'' 
enabling direct, brain-to-brain communication cite:Urban2017.
# Meanwhile, conservative commenters on Breitbart deride 
# Zuckerberg for paving the way to the liberty-infringing policing of ``hate thought'' cite:Nolan2017.

#+caption: A participant uses our brainwave authenticator in his startup's office.
\label{fig:usage}
[[./figures/terrance2.JPG]]

A slew of inexpensive brainscanning devices
underwrite such utopic visions.
2017 saw a BCI for virtual reality gaming cite:Neurable2017
and brainwave-sensing sunglasses cite:Optical2017
join the already large list of inexpensive,
consumer BCIs on the market cite:Levy2017,Interaxon,Grierson2011a.
These devices, 
which are
typically bundled with software development kits (SDKs),
shift the task of building BCIs 
from the realm of research
into the realm of software development.
But what will software developers /do/ with these devices?


# This paper's contribution
# MORGAN: - tease apart utopia/dystopia, what work are they down in silicon valley, in BCI research
# 10-12 participants is respectable
# reach saturation to where you can leave stuff out
# ppl from very diff background always interesting
# recruit someone who hasn't thought about it as much
This study employs a technology probe 
to surface narratives, and anxieties, around consumer BCIs
among professional software engineers.
We provided a working brain-computer interface
to eight software engineers from the San Francisco Bay Area.
As brainscanning devices become more accessible to software developers,
we look to these BCI ``outsiders'' 
as a group likely to participate in the future of brain-computer interface.
Specifically, we provided participants with a brain-based authenticator, 
an application predicated on the notion that a BCI
can detect individual aspects of a person,
making it a potentially fruitful window into broader beliefs 
about what BCIs can reveal cite:Rose2016a,Dumit2004. 

Despite heterogeneous beliefs about the exact nature of the mind,
the engineers in our study shared
a belief that the mind is physical,
and therefore amenable to sensing.
In fact, our participants all believed that the mind could and would 
be ``read'' or ``decoded'' by computers.
We contribute to an understanding of how engineers' beliefs
might foretell the future of brain-controlled interfaces.
If systems are to be built that read the mind in any sense,
we discuss how such systems may bear on the long-term future of privacy and cybersecurity.
# MORGAN - forget 'accurate/usable'  -  not a usability study
# NOURA - are you testing the usability of the authentication system? like, your design of the GUI that instructs them how to use the app and tells them if successful, etc? 
# or the tangible design of the system? sounds like probably not, although you probably want to make a case for why the design is reasonable enough that people didn't struggle to use it
# RICH - Are you really concerned about usability? It sounds like you're trying to look at other issues/values/concerns

** Brain-computer interfaces & pathways to broader adoption

# what are BCIs? 
BCIs allow people to interact with computers without muscular action.
Instead, nervous system activity is translated to a discretized (digital) signal.
BCIs can be categorized broadly as invasive (requiring implantation)
or non-invasive (requiring only external, removable equipment).
Non-invasive, consumer BCIs, are lightweight, require minimal setup, and do not require special gels.
EEG (electroencephalography)
is currently the most viable choice of sensing modality for consumer BCIs cite:Carrino2012.

# BCIs, accessibility now, 
# but sometimes accessibility=>other stuff
# RICHMOND -  think this would be more storngly motivated if you put (or re-summarize) your points about past accessibility tech (like speech to text) broadening to general consumers AND some evidence that people want to envision BCIs as a general consumer device. Also that new people get involved with these. (E.g. lots of VR researchers today weren't VR researchers a decade ago, nor are they the same people who do VR PTSD/therapy research). Therefore, talking to experts who might try to do UX/HCI stuff with it in a few years as it becomes more available is a cool thing. 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design
# http://inclusivedesign.ca/
# - anne  has papers
# - morgan aimes  has papers on  city design
# what might this "other stuff" be? study sf bay to find out
Historically, researchers have conceived of BCIs as accessibility devices,
particularly for individuals with severe muscular disabilities.
However, accessibility devices can sometimes provide routes for early adoption, and thus broader use.
Speech-to-text, for example, was once a tool for individuals who could not type;
eventually, it became adopted as a tool for computer input, now
commonplace in IoT devices such as Alexa and Siri.
Since accessibility devices can give rise to broader consumer adoption,
we ask what such a pathway might look like for brain-computer interfaces.
With an expanding array of inexpensive brainscanning hardware,
many of which come bundled with engineer-friendly SDKs,
the pathway to a future of consumer BCI
increasingly becomes a matter of software engineering.

Thus, we look to software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area.
We use these engineers as a window into broader beliefs about ``Silicon Valley,''
a term we use here to stand in for 
the technical, economic and political
climate that surrounds the contemporary 
technology industry in the area cite:saxenian1996regional.
While we do not believe only Silicon Valley engineers
will influence the future of BCIs,
historically, these engineers have a outsized impact on the
types of technologies developed for mass consumption,
especially with respect to software.
As BCI hardware becomes more accessible,
and therefore more amenable to experimentation as software,
this group once again holds a unique role in
devising a consumer future for this biosensor.
Indeed, the Muse, and similar devices, have robust SDKs and active
developer communities that are building and showcasing BCI applications cite:NeurotechX.

However, we did not want our subjects to have first-hand experience
in developing BCIs, as we did not want them to be primed by existing devices' limitations. Instead,
we selected individuals who indicated they would be interested in experimenting with consumer BCI devices in their free time.
This screening was meant to draw subjects likely to buy consumer devices and develop software for them.
We believed that these engineers' professional expertise in software
development afford a desirable criticality around our technical artifact. 
# In
# other words, these software engineers provided a reasonable starting point in
# interrogating a future for consumer BCI.



# TODO they had no  prior exp. with BCIs..................but why?

# BECAUSE..................
# BCIs.......................basically fictional......
# try to understand how ppl in bay area 
#  understand this device today
#   MORGAN - fine, valid, with proper caveats. 
#   if point is to explore utopianism then you've got to. 
#   would be interesting to compare. industry insiders & people who know about the brain.

# RICHMOND- Maybe it's about thinking about BCIs as a future platform of technology (similar to VR).
*** What brain scans can tell

# IMPROVE TRANSITION 

Brain scanning holds a unique /charisma/ cite:Ames2015,
not only among researchers in related fields cite:Rose2016a,
but among non-experts as well cite:Ali2014a.
Ali et al (2014) found university undergraduates believed a brain scanning device 
(a fake one, unbeknownst to them)
could reveal intimate details of their thoughts,
even after receiving a lecture about the limitations of
brain scanning technologies cite:Ali2014a.
In that study, participants saw
scans of the /brain/
as informative with regard to the /mind/,
a distinct entity that is potentially more expansive than the brain cite:Clark2013,Hayles1999a.

This entanglement of mind and brain has been explored
by past work in science and technology studies.
For example, Dumit's (2004) study of positron emission tomography (PET)
explores
utopian (and dystopian) visions of diagnosing mental illness, or even criminality, 
from scans of a person's brain cite:Dumit2004.
The idea of the mind's ``legibility'' via computational technologies
has been concretely explored by Rose (2016) cite:Rose2016a,
who ties together a number of efforts across neuroscience and cognitive science
to argue that specific technical implementations from these fields
(along with their rhetoric around, and beliefs about the brain)
allow /the mind/ to be ``read'' or ``decoded.''

However, there exists an opportunity
to investigate how pervasive such beliefs are
among those who are not neuroscience experts, 
yet nonetheless technical practitioners.
Given the recent shift of brain scanning equipment from research tool
to consumer electronic device,
we ask what software engineers,
newly able to develop applications around brain scanning,
might build.
Answers to this question could have far-reaching consequences, 
from marketing, to entertainment, to surveillance.
In particular, we aim to center how engineers' ideas about the mind,
especially its relationship to the brain and body,
inform and constrain their beliefs about what BCIs can (and should) do.

*** A BCI technology probe
# study with tech probes + interviews

In this study, we use a technology probe to examine the beliefs of software engineers
about what BCIs can reveal about the mind.
Technology probes are functional apparati
intended to both collect data /in situ/ from participants, and to 
inspire participants to reflect on the probes, and on their beliefs more generally cite:Hutchinson2003.

Probes have a long and diverse history within HCI,
often referring to a variety of different practices cite:Boehner2007.
In the context of our study,
our probe seeks primarily to answer research questions,
rather than to figure as one step in an iterative design process.
Unlike some probes in past work
ours was not intended for longitudinal deployment.
Instead, we aimed to gather beliefs about particular technologies and domains
through a session of open-ended interaction with a device cite:Leahu2014.

Our probe's unfinished appearance was intended to
invite critique and playful experimentation cite:Devendorf2016a,Leahu2014.
However, unlike a mock-up or provocation,
our probe did function as advertised,
allowing participants to 
interact with the devices in an exploratory and unconstrained way
(indeed, many engineers tested that the device's feedback was real).
We designed our probe to steer participants away 
from providing narrow feedback about the interface at hand,
and toward sharing their broader beliefs about the brain and mind.

*** Brain-based authentication

Our study employs a brain-based authenticator as a research probe
to elicit engineers' beliefs about BCIs (and the mind and/or brain they purport to sense).
This section explains how brain-based authentication works,
and why we chose this application for our study.

# defining authentication
Authentication
(i.e., logging into devices and services)
entails a binary classification problem: 
given some token, the authenticator must decide whether or not the person is who they claim to be.
These tokens typically relate to one or more ``factors'': 
knowledge (something one knows, e.g. a password), 
inherence (something one is, such as a fingerprint),
or possession (something one has, such as a device) cite:Chuang2013b.
Brain-based authentication relies on signals generated from individual's brains to uniquely authenticate them,
which has a number of potential advantages over other authentication strategies (see cite:merrill2017future for a review).
First, brainwaves are more difficult to steal than biometrics fingerprints, which are externally visible,
and left in public as one's hands touch objects in the environment.
Brainwaves also change over time, making theft even less likely.
Second, brain-based authentication requires no external performance, making it impervious to ``shoulder-surfing attacks'' (e.g., watching someone enter their PIN). 

# Why authentication here?
We chose to build a
brain-based authenticator
for our study for a few reasons.
First, having participants use a functioning system helped them imagine how they might use BCIs themselves.
Second, the system is a plausible one, backed by peer reviewed research, thus we expected our participants to judge its claims credible.
Third, the system embeds particular assumptions about what brain scanners are able to capture.
Our system embeds ideas that our Muse headset can capture
aspects of individual brains that are unique;
as such, we expect that a working, brain-based authenticator will encourage participants to reflect 
not only on how a BCI applications might be adopted by the broader public,
but also on what BCIs may be able to reveal about the mind and brain,
and to critically examine the limits of what BCIs in general are able to do.

*** Implementation

# device
Since we wanted our technology probe to appear portable enough for use in the real world,
we decided to use a pre-existing consumer EEG device to build our authenticator.
We settled on the Interaxon Muse (Figure \ref{fig:usage}), a $299 headband that can be worn easily,
transmits data wirelessly, and requires no gel to maintain contact between the scalp and electrodes cite:Interaxon.
Using a system that required conductive gel
would have signaled to the participants that the technology is still limited to lab settings, 
and not yet ready for the real world, which could have influenced their responses.

Although the Muse’s signal likely contains noise, a perfectly clean
signal was not necessary to elicit beliefs from subjects in the context of our
technology probe.
Further, despite the Muse's small form-factor and dry electrodes,
past studies have verified its signal is sufficient quality for some neuroscientific research cite:Krigolson2017a.

Due to the device's battery life and intermittent connectivity when walking, the
Muse headband did made a longer-term study impractical. Thus, we opted to
perform a study over a short time and in a controlled environment, drawing on
past technology probe studies with similar constraints
cite:Devendorf2016a,Isbister2006.
# factors we could control in the hourlong setting. 
# are our findings about future pervasiveness limited by the short timescale of our deployment? 
# Past studies have used probes over a short duration [3] and in controlled settings [1,2,4] 
# to surface design considerations aimed at longer-term use.  

# collection / classification
# Specifically, we used the device's raw data as input to our classification system.
Data from the Muse was collected via the device's native OSC interface,
and stored in a timeseries database.
Queries from this database were used to provide training data for a machine learning classifier.
In a preprocessing step, we performed a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to generate frequency-domain data
from the time-domain data.
In the machine learning step, we split a corpus of readings (and labels) into train and validation groups. 
Using XGBoost cite:Chen2016, we trained a binary classifier on seven different splits of the train group.
After the classifier was produced, we validated its performance on the withheld validation set.
# maybe a little bit more clarity on "different splits of the train group," what XGBoost does during this step

# data that it classified
Given a target participant to classify,
our classifier used any reading from this participant as a positive example,
and any reading /not/ from this participant
as a negative example.
Negative examples also included signals with poor quality, and signals from which the device was off-head or disconnected.
Ideally, the resulting classifier should produce "authenticate" labels when the device is on the correct person's head, and "do not authenticate" labels at any other time.
This classifier could output its labels to a simple user interface (UI), described in the next section.
*** Interface

As the device produces data,
the classifier outputs labels of ``accept'' or ``reject.''
Our interface displays these labels as a square of 0s and 1s,
which filled up as data from the device rolled in (Figure \ref{fig:ui}).

Several considerations motivated this design.
First, the UI represents the probabilistic nature of the classification process.
Individual signals may be misclassified, but over blocks of time,
the classifier should be mostly correct (represented as blocks of mostly 0s by our interface).
Thus our simple UI makes visible both 
the underlying mechanism of binary classification,
and its probabilistic nature.
Second, because our UI provides potentially ambiguous feedback
(as opposed to unambiguous signals of "accept" or "reject"),
it allows for potentially richer meaning-making and explanatory work cite:Sengers2006a.
Toward this end, the UI's real-time reactivity
(``blocks'' of 1s and 0s filled in over time) 
allows participants to experiment actively with the device, 
forming and testing hypotheses as to what makes classification succeed or fail.
# feeling another here..."why is this impt?"

# TODO am I doing Boer et al (2012)'s "provotype", or a provocative prototype?????
Finally, our UI gives the probe an ``unfinished'' appearance.
We believed this interface would cause our participants to activate their ``professional vision'' as tech-workers cite:Goodwin1994,
and critique or test the device as if it were a design of their own.
Ideally, we hoped participants would intentionally stress-test the device,
or find playful ways of misusing it.
These misuses could allow participants to form hypotheses about why and how the device succeeds and fails.

** Methods

We recruited participants by word of mouth.
A recruitment email explained that subjects
would interact with a working BCI,
and be asked their opinions about the device, and about BCI broadly.
We screened respondents by their current occupation
and stated interest in experimenting with BCIs in their free time.
# TOOD let's see if i understand this motivation
#      after adding stuff to the related work / motivation section..

# JOHN <2017-09-12 Tue>
# do we mention to subjects this is something we study? effect of credibility?
# > for now I say nothing, err on side of anonymity. if it comes up, mention in rebuttal.

A total of eight people participated, three of which were women.
Participants' ages ranged from 23 to 36.
We met with subjects for a single, one-hour session
in which we trained and tested a brain-based authenticator,
allowing them to interact with it in an open-ended way.

These sessions were designed as a semi-structured interview,
interspersed with conversation between the researcher and the participant.
Our study protocol was approved by our institutional IRB.
Interviews were recorded, and later transcribed.
We performed an ``issue-focused'' analysis of the transcriptions cite:weiss1995learning,
allowing topics and themes to emerge during analysis.
Subjects names were changed to pseudonyms to protect their anonymity.
The remainder of this section describes in detail how subjects
interacted with the device during sessions.

*** Wearing the device

The interviewer began by explaining that participants would wear a BCI,
which we would train to work as an authenticator, answering participants' questions
about how the device would work.
Subjects were told that they would be asked about their opinions on BCIs generally,
and that their anonymized voice and EEG data would be collected.

The interviewer asked participants to place the EEG headband themselves,
and to assure that the device fits comfortably,
at which point
the interviewer would begin recording signals from the device.
Next, the interviewer would ask participants
how they felt about having the EEG device on their head.
This question would typically begin a short, open-ended exchange
about their past experience with brain-scanning devices,
and prior knowledge, if any, of BCIs.
This exchange would segue into a broader discussion about the participant's 
use and relationship with technology, in personal and work life.

After this initial conversation, the interviewer would perform a brief /calibration/ step with the participant,
in which data are collected to train a custom classifier for use in authentication.
Participants would perform a number of tasks, or /mental gestures/, 
prompted by a stimulus presentation program.
These tasks provide a more diverse corpus of an individual's signals,
which should enable a more robust (and accurate) classifier.
After this calibration procedure, which usually lasted about ten minutes,
the interviewer would perform a semi-structured interview with participants.
The interviewer would continue to record data from the Muse throughout this interview.
# maybe a little more clarity that the participant is just sitting there with a clicker in front of a laptop screen as instructions are displayed
# how many tasks, how long per task?

*** Using the authenticator

At this point, the interviewer would explain to participants that the data collected thus far
would be used to train an custom authenticator for them.
The interviewer would explain roughly how the authenticator would work:
the probe should /accept/ readings when the participant is wearing the device,
and /reject/ readings in any other case.

Next, the interviewer would run a script that trained our XGBoost classifier (Section [[Implementation]]).
Participants could watch the training process run, if interested (a few were).
After the training process completed, the researcher would set up the UI (Section [[Interface]])
and allow participants to view the classifier's output in real-time using live data from the participant's Muse device.
Participants would then see the probe's /accept/ or /reject/ classifications using the live data from their headset.

After allowing participants to acclimate to the output, and answering any preliminary questions,
the interviewer would encourage the participant to experiment with the authenticator, and share any impressions, reactions or ideas.
The open-endedness of this session was meant to encourage participants to explore the device's capabilities and limitations, free of particular tasks to accomplish.
However, we suspected that our participant population would be particularly prone to ``hypothesis-testing,'' exploring the devices limitations by building theories about how it might work.
We structured the session around this assumption, preparing to ask participants to think aloud as they explored the device's capabilities.

After some free-form exploration (usually involving some back-and-forth with the participant),
the interviewer would transition into a semi-structured interview, 
which would occur with the device still active.
The interviewer would ask participants to unpack their experience,
and lead them to explore what they felt the device could reveal about them.
After some discussion, the formal interview would conclude, and the participants would remove the Muse device from their head.
# In several cases, participants wished to continue conversations after the study ended.
# The interviewer and participant would move to an informal environment (a cafe or pub) and continue dialogue on study themes and topics. 
# These conversations were recorded with participants' consent.
# When all conversations concluded, the interviewer would explain to participants the research goals of the study.

** Experiencing the authenticator

# John <2017-08-22 Tue>
# we can collect from 8 participants, focus on some subset
# who can you point to, show analysis legit? 
#  > freaky

In general, we found particular reflections to come at
different points in the interview protocol.
Critiques (and questions) about the device narrowly tended to come
as soon as engineers placed the device on their heads.
Reflections on the BCI broadly, and its future trajectories, tended to come after
viewing the probe's feedback for some time.
As these conversations progressed, participants naturally 
tended to reflect on what future BCIs could do.
Subjects would typically
relate the capacities of the probe, and of possible future technologies,
to their ideas about the mind, body or brain.
The probe continued to run during these discussions.
Toward the end of the interview,
the researcher would prompt participants to reflect on any anxieties
they might have about the future of BCIs
(interestingly, only one participant raised this subject on their own).
The remainder of this section is organized to roughly mirror
this common order of participants' reflections during interviews.

*** Using the BCI probe
Our working authenticator elicited diverse reactions from the engineers in our study.
Almost all participants cracked jokes after putting on the headband
(three subjects commented that they felt like they were ``from Star Trek'').
All participants except Joanna said they would not wear the device in public,
though a few conceded that they might if the headsets were more common.
Terrance commented,
``If most people are doing it, then it's fine. 
Sort of like stock speculation.''

Perceptions of the authenticator's accuracy were mixed.
Four participants found that the authenticator worked well for them.
For these participants, the authenticator consistently rejected blocks when the headset was off of their head, 
or worn by the researcher.

On the other hand,
four participants found the probe consistently rejected every reading, whether it came from them or the researcher
(i.e., they experienced false rejections, but not false acceptances).
These subjects often tried to remedy the situation by attempting tasks they had rehearsed, typically with mixed success.
Most of these subjects concluded that there was not enough training data to produce reliable classification,
but that such a system would work with a larger corpus.
In contrast,
Alex, a 30 year-old founder of an indoor agriculture startup,
blamed himself, saying ``I must not produce very distinguishable thoughts.''

Those participants who felt the probe's authentication was reliable
tended to center their explanations on why it worked.
Participants who experienced less consistent accuracy with the authenticator
tended to center their explanations on how the device might be improved,
e.g. with better or more comprehensive sources of data.
This impulse to ``fix'' likely speaks to our participants' general tendency to engineer working systems,
which extended in our case even to this experimental technology.

# When getting acquainted with the authenticator,
# participants often took the device off to see if it (correctly) failed to authenticate them.
# Five of the eight participants asked the researcher to wear the device, to see if it failed.
# Many expressed some initial skepticism that the device really worked,
# indicating that the feedback might be false; several others were simply skeptical
# about the device's accuracy.
# This skepticism was encouraged by the interviewers,
# as we hoped it would provide a grounds for expressing
# their opinions about BCIs more generally.

As we hoped, the engineers engaged critically with the technical implementation of the probe.
In general, engineers asked about the machine learning infrastructure underlying the authenticator,
and several participants (particularly John, Mary and Alex) asked specific questions,
and made specific recommendations, diagnosing issues with the authenticator
by thinking about the diversity and size of the training set.
Almost all participants noted the authenticator worked better when 
they were not looking at the visual feedback from the user interface.
Participants generally theorized that this might occur because they were not viewing feedback when training the classifier.
In these cases, the engineers appeared to apply their domain knowledge 
to their observations in using our technology probe.

# Contrary to our expectations, the probe's feedback
# was rarely interpreted as being ambiguous. Participants
# tended to view the blocks as either unambiguous ``accepts'' or ``rejects.''
# It is unclear whether this lack of observed ambiguity 
# was a shortcoming of our interface,
# an effect of our probe's focus on authentication,
# or a quirk of our participants.

*** Reflecting on the future of BCI

# Our technology probe was designed to elicit broader beliefs about BCI, 
# and other topics that participants might find relevant or interesting.
Our technology probe
caused almost all of our participants to speculate on the future of BCIs generally.
To most participants, the future of BCIs seemed to be largely pre-determined.
One of our participants, Terrance (a 24 year-old software engineer at a small transportation startup), 
removed the headband to inspect it, and commented on its awkward visibility.
In doing so, he reflected on the future of BCIs, 
speaking in no uncertain terms about a future of computer-mediated ``telepathy.'' 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Things just get progressively smaller until they disappear. And one day this'll
just be an implant in my brain, doing crazy things. It'll be interesting
socially, how people come to terms with it, when it's just an implant, or at
least very pervasive ... I could send you a message, and it could be like you're
thinking it yourself, even if you're on the other side of the Bay. /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE

Terrance believed that BCI /will/ become more prevalent:
not just that smaller sensors will lead to more effective or usable BCIs,
but that they will also result in greater uptake of the technology.
While he references the social dimension of their adoption,
he indicates that people will need to ``come to terms with'' the developments,
rather than providing direct agency to users who may choose to adopt the technology or not.

Two participants felt less sure that such a future of pervasive BCI would ever come to pass.
Elizabeth, a 30 year-old front-end engineer, noted skepticism about signal quality, or usefulness 
outside of persons with disabilities.
Mary, a 27 year-old software engineer at a large company, pointed to social reasons for her skepticism. 
In reflecting on the relative accuracy of the probe's authentication performance during her session,
she commented that ``90 plus percent'' of people would be ``totally freaked out'' by brain-computer interfaces generally.
She continued to say that companies may themselves stop BCIs from becoming too pervasive or advanced.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I feel like those companies, even if this were feasible, there's a moral quandary they philosophically have not figured out. 
They will not let the research get that advanced ... I just don't imagine them being like, "okay computer, now read our brains." /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

While the probe was effective in spurring subjects to talk about
issues around BCIs, its accuracy as an authentication device
did not seem to alter participants' belief in BCI's future
as a widespread technology.
Unsurprisingly, the four subjects who experienced reliable authenticator accuracy
all expressed that BCIs would become commonplace in the future.
However, only Joanna connected the device's poor performance in her session
with a probability of ongoing accuracy issues for BCIs in the future.
The other three subjects who felt the device did not perform accurately
all offered explanations as to why, and explained
that future devices would fix these issues.

*** Mind, brain, body

# mind-as-computational-brain 
During their interactions with the probe,
almost all of our subjects discussed their
deeper beliefs about the nature of the mind, 
and its relationship to the brain and body.
Since participants discussed
the future trajectory of BCIs led to discussions
while the probe continued to work (or fail),
the subject often arose of what BCIs might be able to detect, even theoretically.
As one example, John, a 26 year-old software engineer at a small chat startup, 
noticed that the authenticator only worked when he was speaking, 
but not when he was listening to the researcher.
He offered an explanation for the discrepancy.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There's probably some kind of fundamental difference between creating thoughts
and consuming thoughts. You're still making thoughts, right, but it's almost
like programming versus being programmed. /(John)/
#+END_QUOTE

When pressed on how strictly he meant his metaphor of programming, John
confirmed that he meant it quite literally, saying, /``I think we are just
computers that are way more sophisticated than anything we understand right
now.''/ We return to this strictly computational account of the mind as ``just''
a computer in the discussion.

Mary gave a computational account of mind that was more metaphorical than
John's, drawing on comparisons between machine learning and the mind. She cited
the many ``hidden layers'' in deep neural networks, and that, like in the brain,
``information is largely distributed.'' While she believed deep learning models
and the brain were ``different systems foundationally,'' she said ``there are
patterns'' that relate the two to one another, and indicated that advances in
deep learning would spur a greater understanding of the brain.

Although six of our participants provided a largely computational account of
mind-as-brain, not all did. Joanna, a 31 year-old engineer who previously
completed a PhD in neuroscience, felt that the mind was ``the part of the brain
I am aware of, the part that is conscious.'' She believed that neurotransmitters
throughout the body have a causal relationship to what happens in the mind, but
do not constitute the mind themselves; the contents of mind occur physically in
the brain, and the brain alone. In other words, her account is one of ``mind as
conscious awareness,'' and while unconscious phenomena affect mind (e.g. the
body, environment), they are not part of the mind /per se/. Interestingly, the
probe did not work well for Joanna, and she felt confident that its poor
performance was due to contaminating signal from her body (a theory she tested,
and validated, by moving around and observing the probe's feedback).


Meanwhile, in one subject's account, the mind extended beyond the confines of
the body. Terrance felt that there was ``no meaningful difference'' between the
body and brain, nor between the body and the physical environment at large,
saying that ``you can't have one without the other.'' He believed that all three
of these entities constitute the mind in a mutually-dependent way. However,
Terrance indicated that the mind is still strictly physical, as are these three
entities. Although Terrance did not provide details on how exactly the mind
extended beyond the body, it is interesting to note this position's similarities
to Clark's (2013) account of the extended mind cite:Clark2013, or Edward
Hutchins's work on distributed cognition cite:Hutchins2005, though Terrance was
familiar with neither.

Participants also offered differing levels of confidence in their beliefs about
the nature of the mind. Joanna (who has a background in neuroscience) reported
that ``we do not know everything we need to know'' about how the mind works.
Three other subjects reported similar beliefs. However, those subjects with a
computational account of mind tended to feel more confident that their account
was substantially accurate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think the consensus is that the body is mostly like the I/O of the brain.  /(John)/
#+END_QUOTE

John's account here implies that a sufficiently high-resolution brain sensor
would accurately capture all of a person's experiences. John confirmed this
explicitly, saying /``if you could 3D print a brain, and apply the correct
electrical impulses, you could create a person in a jar.''/ In this
computational metaphor of I/O (input/output), the body itself does not have
agency; instead, the body actuates the brain's commands (output), and senses the
environment, sending data to brain for processing (input).

*** Reading the mind

As discussed in the previous section,
every participant's account of mind was strictly physical, 
rooted mostly in the brain, in a few cases in the body, 
and in one case extending beyond the body to the physical world.
With this physical understanding of the mind,
it is not overly surprising that
all participants believed it would someday be possible for a
computer to read or decode the contents of the human mind.
No participants expressed hesitation when asked about such a proposition.

For example, Alex did not feel comfortable providing a specific physical locus for the mind.
Although he did not feel the probe was accurate for him,
he took great pains to express his belief that such a device could work,
though not necessarily by sensing the brain.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We're driven by single-celled organisms in ways we don't really yet understand, but...
there's got to be some sort of physical storage of memories or experiences.
We just haven't quite learned how to read it yet. /(Alex)/
#+END_QUOTE

Though it leaves open room for a variety of interpretations 
about the exact nature of mind, 
Alex's view
is explicit that thoughts are physical, therefore /can/ be read,
and /will/ be read with some future technology.

There was a great deal of heterogeneity in the way this belief was bracketed or qualified.
Joanna felt that there would ``always be parts of the mind that can't be seen.''
She likened the question to the way that other people can know some parts of another person's mind, e.g. through empathy;
their perspective, however, would always be partial, and she felt the same would be true for machines.

However, some participants did not bracket their belief that machines would someday read the mind.
Participants for whom the authenticator worked reliably
typically said that a mind-reading machine was ``absolutely possible'' (Mary)
or ``just a matter of the right data'' (Alex).
Participants who did not feel the authenticator was accurate
described current state-of-the-art as ``crude'' (John) or ``low-granularity'' (Elizabeth).

Even Terrance, who believed the mind extended beyond the confines of the body,
felt that the mind was readable by machine.
After he stated his personal belief in a mind that extended
to the physical environment, the experimenter asked
what consequence this belief might have for the future of BCIs.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Practically, it has no implication. We could still devise an authentication tool
that does the job, and it doesn't matter. Maybe in some way there could be this
ESP thing where you could somehow read my thoughts... If we want to do
something, we will find a way. /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE

# Although he did not believe the mind to be one discrete, physical entity,
# he felt that that one could still come up with a ``convention'' by which the mind becomes readable.
# In this view, ``shorthands'' or constructed understandings hold their own reality, outside of any ``absolute'' notion of the world.
Terrance's language here belies broader narratives of positive technological progress 
(notions of ``[moving] forward,'' and that ``we will find a way'').
Despite his personal beliefs about the ``true'' nature of the mind,
he felt that engineers would manage to build the systems they intended to build,
even ones with a much higher specificity than those available today (e.g. an ``ESP device'').

*** BCIs for everyone?

Generally, participants stated (implicitly or explicitly) that BCI technologies 
would become smaller, less expensive, more accurate,
and therefore become prevalent as a consumer device.
Only Mary raised the question of how institutions exert agency 
over the artifacts they create.
Where most subjects indicated BCIs become smaller and thus more pervasive,
Mary indicated that companies have beliefs, 
which affect what devices and technologies they produce.
Specifically, Mary spoke of a ``quandary''
between advancing technology on one hand,
and systems' autonomy on the other.
She viewed this reluctance to allow systems to become more autonomous
as a signal that certain technologies, potentially including BCIs, may /not/ be developed
for ethical, moral or philosophical reasons.

Interestingly, the other seven engineers in our study
expected a future in which BCIs are pervasive,
in spite of their unwillingness to wear our probe's headband in public.
Some subjects believed the device's awkward, outward visibility
might be mitigated by future miniaturization.
Other subjects felt that social norms may simply change
if the device became pervasive. This latter attitude is reminiscent of
those around Google Glass, which shared an awkward (and, in practice, often stigmatizing)
visibility cite:wong2016product.
Future work might draw out the relationship
of Google Glass's imagined future to that of BCI,
perhaps as a way of learning lessons about possible commercial failures,
and how engineering communities may have failed to foresee them.

*** BCI anxieties

An important counterpoint to emerging technologies is the anxiety that rises
along with them cite:Pierce2017. Interestingly, engineers in our study expressed
no strong anxieties regarding the development of BCIs, for the most part.
Regardless of their experiences with our probe, participants felt that BCIs
would be developed, and would improve people's lives. Participants mentioned
domains such as work, safety, and increased convenience in the home.
# With respect to ``mind-reading'' in particular
# (which all participants agreed was a technical possibility), 
# Terrance reported that he ``really wanted it to happen.'' 
# Alex cited communication as one application of such a technology,
# and John cited virtual reality.

Only Mary reported existential anxiety about the possibility of machines that
could read the human mind. She reported a technology to be ``absolutely
possible,'' and referenced the probe's continuing high accuracy as we spoke.
However, in stark contrast to Terrance, Mary /feared/ such a development would
occur sooner rather than later.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I hope it's fifteen years out, but realistically, it's probably more like ten. /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

Despite Mary's prior statement about the power of institutions to
change the course of technical developments, here she seems to indicate that
such course changes will not occur, or that they will converge on machines that can read the mind.

When pressed on downsides, the participants who did not volunteer any anxieties
about BCI initially did mention security (especially the ``leaking'' of
``thoughts'') as a concern. For example, Elizabeth did not report any particular
anxieties about BCIs in general, ``if the proper protections are in place.''
Pressed on what those protections might look like, she cited encryption as a
solution to privacy concerns. Terrance, who expressed wanting BCIs to become
more widespread, described in deterministic terms the cybersecurity issues such
devices might pose.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If there are security holes - which there almost certainly will be - then what
happens when I'm leaking my thoughts to someone? What if I'm thinking about the
seed phrase for my Bitcoin wallet... and then you put it in this anonymized
dataset ... and I lose all my coins? What then? /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE


# Even though the probe exhibited poor accuracy for him,
# Terrance's concerns predicate a high degree of specificity about what the device is able to detect.
Even alongside his concern, Terrance very much wanted a mind-reading machine to
exist. He mentioned a desire for a programming assistant that would somehow
speed up the process of software development. Since Terrance's conception of BCI
presents high stakes with regards to privacy and security (he variously
mentioned ``telepathy,'' and an ``ESP device,'' implying a high degree of
specificity with regard to what BCIs can resolve), it is telling that he thought
primarily of using BCIs to become a more efficient engineer, rather than
concerns around privacy or potential harm. Later in the discussion, we unpack
further how larger cultural tendencies in Silicon Valley might shape the way
engineers build BCI systems.

** Discussion

# Our decision to examine the beliefs of engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area stemmed from our desire to surface narratives among engineers
# as a way of understanding what they might design.
# In particular, we wondered what kind of utopian visions and/or anxieties
# might inform the design (or reluctance to design) BCIs for everyday use.

# Since our subjects were pre-screened for potential interest in BCIs, they may have been more likely to be enthusiastic....
# We find that engineers hold diverse beliefs about what the mind is, 
# what the brain is, and about the relationship between these entities.
# However, all of these engineers shared a core belief that the mind is a physical entity, one that machines can and will decode given the proper equipment and algorithms.
# Overall, the engineers in our study were enthusiastic about the development of such devices.
# The remainder of this discussion synthesizes our findings around four core subjects.
# First, we discuss engineers' belief that BCIs will become more pervasive in the future.
# Second, we discuss the belief of a machine-readable mind shared by all the engineers in our study.
# We unpack this belief, discussing how subjects qualified, justified and defended it.
# Third, we connect our findings to implications for long-term future for cybersecurity and privacy online.
# Finally, we discuss our finding's implications for 
# how engineers, like those in our study, might design future devices,
# and how we as researchers might track their developments in the coming years.

We find that engineers hold diverse beliefs about what the mind is, what the
brain is, and about the relationship between these entities. However, all of
these engineers shared a core belief that the mind is a physical entity, one
that machines can and will decode given the proper equipment and algorithms
(Section 6.1). Despite this belief, engineers did not largely express concerns
about privacy or security (Section 6.2). As BCI startups continue to grow, we
propose further work within technical communities, with a sensitivity toward
emerging narratives, so that we may instill criticality among this emerging
technical practice (Section 6.3). We conclude with avenues for future work
focusing on different communities of technical practice (Section 6.4).

*** Physical mind, readable mind

Although our engineers broadly believed BCIs would become pervasive as consumer devices,
we found no consistent visions of what such a future might look like.
Instead, and to our surprise, we found a shared belief that
there exists a physical mind that can be ``read'' or ``decoded'' by machines,
despite participants' heterogeneous beliefs about its exact nature.
Interestingly, only one participant shared any anxiety about this prospect with the researchers; 
the other participants reported looking forward to such a possibility.

Crucial to beliefs about the machine-readable mind were frames
of the mind as physical, and therefore amenable to sensing.
In many cases, subjects would use analogies to computation in making this point.
For example, John 
observed an anomaly in the authenticator's performance (it did not work when he was listening to the experimenter speak).
He theorized that the states are distinguishable, because speaking ``is like programming'' and listening to someone speak ``is like being programmed''.
In this case, John's observations about the BCI
met with his pre-existing notions of the mind, 
producing a hypothesis for what ``brain states'' might exist
/and/ what states Muse headset might be able to detect.
Hypotheses such as these could be consequential,
as they might provide ideas or starting points for engineers looking to build systems.
Our results highlight the importance of both pre-existing beliefs
and particular interactions with BCIs 
in structuring engineers' understandings.

Broadly, engineers' beliefs about the mind-as-computer metaphor (Section [[Mind,
brain, body]]) could provide starting points for engineers to build BCIs in the
future. This computational view of mind has been popular among engineers at
least since the ``good old-fashioned AI'' (GOFAI) of the 1950s. While much work
has critiqued this stance from various angles cite:Agre1997,Hayles1999a, those
same critiques have acknowledged the role these metaphors have played in the
development of novel technologies: If the mind is a machine, then those tools
used to understand machines can also be used to understand the mind. Here, we
see this metaphor return, its discursive work now focused on biosensing rather
than on artificial intelligence. Of course, these metaphors illuminate certain
possibilities while occluding others cite:Hayles1999a. As such, future work
should follow past research cite:Agre1997 in understanding what work this
metaphor might do in its new domain of computational mind-reading.

Even those participants who did not subscribe to computational theories of mind
still believed the mind to be strictly physical. These subjects all agreed that
computers could someday read the mind, precisely because of its physical nature.
While our results indicate that engineers believe the mind to be
machine-readable, some work indicates that non-engineers may share this as well
cite:Ali2014a. Future work could further investigate this claim more deeply in
the context of consumer BCIs. If so, a machine designed by engineers and
purported to read the mind might find acceptance among a broader public
audience.


# _TODO maybe interesting to note that terrance did NOT think the mind was in the brain, but STILL thought we could "find a way" to read the mind fro brain because we can just do it by convention. so maybe unpack THAT.......if it fits here_
Those subjects with a computational account of mind tended to feel more
confident that their account was substantially accurate. John referenced ``the
consensus'' in justifying his beliefs about the mind being equivalent to the
brain. It is worth asking whose consensus this might be: that of
neuroscientists, philosophers of mind, cognitive scientists, or engineers? In
any of these cases, engineers' confidence in their beliefs could have
implications for what types of systems are considered buildable, and where
engineers might look to validate their implementations. As products come to
market, professionals in the tech industry must find ways of claiming their
devices to be legitimate, or working, to the public (consumers), to potential
investors, and to other engineers. These claims of legitimacy could prove to be
a fruitful window for understanding the general sensemaking process around these
devices as their (perceived) capabilities inevitably evolve and grow alongside
changing technologies.

*** A future for privacy and security

Since the engineers in our study believed the mind to be readable, an important
question remains around the consequences for the future of consumer privacy and
security. Our participants largely acknowledged that ``leaking'' thoughts
through security holes was a valid concern, and one participant claimed that
these exploitable holes will ``almost certainly'' exist. However, the types of
threats that engineers referenced may not square with the notion of BCIs as a
device for the masses. For example, Terrance's concern about someone stealing
his Bitcoins through some BCI-based attack involves a technology which for now
remains niche. This imagined scenario demonstrates how the security (and
privacy) concerns of engineers may not match that of the general public. Such
mismatches could have consequences for the types of systems that are designed,
and whose needs these systems will account for.

Crucially, discussions about privacy and security concerns did not cause any
participants to reflect further on the consequences of pervasive BCIs, nor did
they deter enthusiasm for the development of these devices. These findings
indicate either that engineers are not be inclined to prioritize security in the
systems they build, or that they have resigned themselves to the inevitability
of security holes in software. In either case, our findings suggest a long-term
direction for cybersecurity concerns. These devices carry potentially serious
security and privacy consequences. If our engineers will try to build devices
that make judgments about the inner workings of a person's mind, future work
must critically examine how to protect such systems, and the people who use
them.
# Even those participants who believed that BCIs
# could ``leak thoughts'' with relative specificity
# felt the development of these same technologies 
# to be at once appropriate, desirable and inevitable.

*** Implications for the design of mind-reading machines

Our findings do not indicate a singular path for the future of BCIs. Instead,
they indicate an undercurrent of belief among Silicon Valley engineers in the
possibility of technologies that can read the contents of the human mind.
Crucially, our study revealed narratives not just around BCIs, but around the
nature of the brain and mind generally, which in turn legitimize narratives
about the possibility of mind-reading machines.

Despite these beliefs about what BCIs are capable of, only one participant in
our study reported that ethical issues around privacy or security might deter
their development. We hope engineers will become more reflexive about these
beliefs around BCI, and more critical about their downstream potential for harm
(e.g. surveillance). Much as utopian dialogues around the potential of the World
Wide Web missed risks to privacy and security, so might similarly utopian ideals
of mind-reading machines.

Since the engineers in our study believed BCIs could perform this potentially
invasive ``mind-reading,'' why did they largely want such BCIs to be built?
Explanations might be found by relating the narratives we uncover to existing
social and economic value systems within Silicon Valley communities. Biohacking,
for one example, has become an established part of Silicon Valley culture,
through dieting (e.g. Soylent, fasting), or more extreme forms of body
modification (e.g. chipping) cite:Dolejsova2017. Underlying all of these
cultures is a mechanical model of the body, which facilitates notions of
optimization and experimentation. How might BCIs (especially ones that purport
to read thoughts) work their way into these already-established cultural
patterns? We note that existing consumer BCIs already situate themselves in this
context: the Muse headset we used in this study markets itself primarily as a
meditation trainer (its advertising copy claims to ``remove the uncertainty from
meditation'') cite:Interaxon. Examining how BCIs perform discursive work in
engineering communities will allow us to better understand engineers' intents as
these devices begin to emerge, and help us trace these intents forward as
devices are re-imagined, remixed and repackaged for other groups of users in the
future.
# Meditation also harkens to 
# eastern spirituality generally, 
# which has a long-entrenched history in the Bay Area, and in the software engineering community at large _[?????]_.
# (Indeed, two of our participants picked a yoga sun salutation as one of their mental gestures).

In the nascent field of consumer BCI, researchers and designers should remain in
touch with the beliefs of engineers. We pinpoint beliefs about the mind, and its
readability by emerging biosensing devices, as especially an critical facet.
Doing so will allow design to remain preemptive rather than reactive as software
for consumer BCI emerges. Designers and researchers must not remain on the
sidelines; as devices come to market, we must become actively engaged in
engineers' beliefs (and practices). These systems hold the potential for
exploiting an unprecedented level of personal data, and therefore present an
high potential for harm. As such, the area presents a new locus for researchers
and designers to engage critically with technical developments.

# *** TODO BCI & biopolitics
# _??????????????? should I bring biopolitics into this or is that a separate paper ??????????????? Matthew sample ?????????????????_

*** Future work

Software engineers are a diverse group, and the geographic confines of Silicon
Valley do not describe all communities worldwide. Future work could explore
communities in different places. Engineers in non-Western contexts may hold
different cultural beliefs about the mind, which could lead to vastly different
findings.

# Even within Silicon Valley, engineers are heterogeneous in their cultures, interests and practices.
# Future work could focus on a few, specific sub-populations with the Silicon Valley technology community.
Professionals who work in machine learning could present another
participant pool for future work. Machine learning is a critical component of
BCIs, and many contemporary techniques, particularly deep
learning, use neural metaphors to interpret and designing algorithms
cite:ba2016using. Thus, practitioners of these techniques may be inclined to draw
metaphors between the brain and the algorithms they employ, which could color
their understanding how and why BCIs work or fail.

# For example, employees in private companies actively working on building brain-computer interfaces
# could provide a useful point of comparison to the software engineers in our study, who were not BCI experts.

Future work could allow participants to take an active, participatory role in
the analysis of their data, and/or in the design of the BCI system. Although our
participants had the technical expertise required to perform data analysis and
systems engineering themselves, we did not have participants do any such
analysis for this study. This participatory approach will also help us expand
our understanding from engineers' beliefs to engineers' practices, as they
relate to the emerging domain of consumer brain-computer interfaces.
Participants might form their own interpretations of what the data mean (or can
mean), building understandings that could differ from those we observed in this
study.

# future work could perform
# ``speculative enactments'' _[elsden]_ with our research tool, in which activities with the device
# could result in real-world consequences.
# For example, people must authenticate with our device in order to log into their real services.
# These deployments might necessitate longer-duration experiences with the device, as well. 
# Deployments with real stakes, over longer timescales, could radically change the interpretations and beliefs that our study elicits.

** Conclusion

# With regard to the brain and mind, what is their truth?
As engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area,
the participants in our study sit at 
an historical site of techno/political power.
Our technology probe indicates these engineers
believe the mind is physical, and therefore amenable to sensing.
What are the consequences for the rest of us?
We hope our study will encourage engineers to closely examine
the potential of these devices for social harm,
and encourage researchers to remain closely attuned
to this emerging class of consumer biosensor.

# From highly-publicized leaks cite:Selyukh2017 to accidental tweets by White
# House officials mistakes cite:Palma2017, passwords suffer from long-standing
# issues around usability cite:Bonneau2012. 
In response to long-standing issues with passwords cite:Selyukh2017,Palma2017,
consumer devices are increasingly turning away from passwords and toward
/inherence-factor authentication/, which rely on properties of the body, such as
fingerprints or facial scans. These systems are diverse in their sensing
modalities, but similar in their use of digitized identifiers from the body as
tokens of personhood. Whereas passwords can be given to others, these
identifiers by design cannot be distributed: they are meant to verify not
access, buy particular bodies.

However, inherence-factor authentication brings its own challenges: Apple's
FaceID cannot distinguish between twins cite:Hern2017; a child can use her
sleeping mother's finger to authenticate cite:Johnson2017. Such shortcomings beg
the question: what is the ground truth for the personhood inherence-based
classifiers seek to verify? How does this personhood relate to the bodily
identifiers they collect?
# M - why do authetication systems have to "capture" the self anyway - really
#     what they need is one easily-measureable unique identifier, not the "whole" self?

# morgan - better justify use of software engineers in second and third
#          paragraphs, especially given the results in the third paragraph. 
In this study, we built a system that uses a brainscanner to authenticate users
based on their neural signals. This system was highly experimental, prone to
false acceptances and false rejections. It produced a continuous, probabilistic,
and often ambiguous ``determination'' about the identity of the person wearing
it.

We provided this system to software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area,
aiming to use this probe to surface
their beliefs about the ``true'' nature of the self, and its
relationship to biometric identifiers generally.
These engineers represent a community of technical practioners
who, through their position in a global software industry cite:saxenian1996regional,
have the potential to actively construct notions of selves
through authentication or other applications.
By surfacing their ideas about personhood,
we hope to raise alternatives for design
that are sensitive to various conceptions of selfhood.

# We believe these engineers have an outsized impact on what sorts of systems
# will get developed and deployed.....

# We center the multiple ways this group
# conceives of the relationship between the brain, the body, and the self. _how
# beliefs about the relationship between /the brain/ and /the self/ inform and
# constrain their beliefs about what authentication can do._

Although we set out expecting to discover how engineers' beliefs about the self
mirror the notions of self embedded in typical authentication systems, we
instead find that these software engineers hold complex notion of self involving
multiple, material contingencies over time, which existing authentication
systems do not capture. 
Through these diverse notions of personhood,
we possibilities for the design of authentication systems,
and other systems in which the self is modeled (explicitly or implicitly).

# We discuss implications for how authentication systems
# can be seen as ``working,'' and push toward a design criticism focused on
# cybsersecurity systems and their broader consequences.

** Background
*** Authentication, bodies persons

This section traces how passwords' shortcomings
motivated a shift to inherence-based authentication, and how this shift
presented the novel challenges addressed in the present work. This section
concludes by claiming that, in their quest to verify personhood, inherence-based
authentication systems make particular epistemological commitments about how
persons are defined. These persons or ``selves'' are what systems are tasked
with classifying; they are the ground truth through which a system's success and
failure are understood.

**** A brief history of authentication

In computer security, authentication schemes seek to verify that a user is who
they claim to be. Authentication is traditionally established via a taxonomy of
``factors'': something one knows (knowledge, e.g. a password), something one is
(inherence, e.g. a fingerprint), or something one has (possession, e.g. a
keycard). For enhanced security, ``multi-factor'' authentication overlays
multiple of these properties. A common two-factor (2FA) scheme requires the
knowledge factor of one's password along with the possession factor of one's
phone.

# CTSS Programmers Guide, 2nd Ed., MIT Press, 1965
# http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D34
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countersign_(military)#cite_note-1
The concept of using a secret phrase for authentication has a largely military
history, insofar as its use has been recorded. US soldiers shared a famous
challenge-response password on D-Day: were two unfamiliar soldiers to meet, the
first would say /``flash,''/ the second would reply /``thunder,''/ and the first
would confirm, /``welcome''/ cite:lewis2004d. However, the use of passwords was
documented as early as 146 BC among the Roman military by the Greek historian
Polybius cite:mcging2010polybius (6.34).

Passwords have been used to manage access in computer systems since at least
1961 cite:crisman1965compatible. They offer many benefits in a computing context: they require
no special hardware to enter, beyond a keyboard, and they can be shared easily
between people. This latter feature makes passwords a tool for /authorization/
(of access) rather than a tool for /authentication/ (of personhood). 

**** A shift to inherence

Despite passwords' strengths, high-profile leaks and breaches serve as regular
reminders that passwords have serious security issues, particularly around
usability cite:Bonneau2012. In response to the shortcoming of passwords, the
Apple iPhone introduced inherence-based authentication in 2013. This fingerprint
scanner stems from a long forensic history of fingerprint analysis (and much
crticism about the practice's accuracy) cite:nelson2010america. At the time of
its introduction in computer security, the paradigm were seen as less prone to
``security mistakes'' on the part of users. Based on properties of the body,
they are widely seen as more difficult to steal than passwords, and particularly
less suceptible to attacks involving remote access.

However, the integration of biometrics creates a new problem for the systems
that utilize them: their access is now predicated on characteristics of bodies.
Rather than establishing knowledge of a token, inherence-based systems establish
/personhood/ using physical tokens from the body cite:nelson2010america. In
doing so, these systems actively construct a notion of the self around the
tokens they are able to detect.
# UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH kind of wanting more here tbh

In this study, we ask: How do these constructed selves match to beliefs about
the /true/ ground self of personhood? As we discuss in the next section, we look
to software engineers in particular, whose beliefs we consider particularly
relevant in reflecting on what types of authentication systems have already been
deployed (are their models sufficient?), and into surfacing alternative systems
that may reflect other conceptions of self or personhood.

*** The beliefs of software engineers

Our focus on software engineers, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area,
is motivated by this group's outsized impact on the sorts of systems that are
developed and deployed globally. We believe this group's beliefs about the
nature of the self will have a tight relationship to their technical practice.
By surfacing their beliefs, we will be able to better anticipate the systems
they may build, and also to help raise alternatives for design that are
compatible with engineers' beliefs.
# _yes..they might build shit that matters ;)_

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# A - why their BELIEFS matter, ANT on one side, death of
# the network on the other, why beliefs vs what systmes do in the world
# #+END_QUOTE
What we do not yet know is how engineers' beliefs about the self inform the
design of authentication systems generally. Following Agre's study of artificial
intelligence practitioners, cite:Agre1997, we note that it is also unclear how
philosophically committed systems designers are to the epistemological
implications of authentication systems. Would they agree what current
authentication systems offer practical workaround for pragmatic ends? Or would
they argue that there is one true self per person, and/or that existing systems
correctly identify the ground truth of personhood?

# TODO explain why these questions are weighty/consequential
#      e.g. why it matters for the way the world is organized.

*** Technology probe

This paper seeks to grapple with these questions by examining what this
group believes the self /is/, and how current authentication systems map to
their beliefs. In doing so, we hope to find room both to critique the
commitments underpinning authentication systems, to raise alternative systems
for authenticating persons, and to think about their consequences. We hope this
investigation can move toward a role for research-through-design in
cybersecurity, a point we will return to this point in the discussion.

In this study, we presented participants with a technology probe. Technology
probes are functional apparati intended to both collect data /in situ/ from
participants, and to inspire participants to reflect on the probes, and on their
beliefs more generally cite:Hutchinson2003. Probes have a long and diverse
history within HCI, often to a variety of different practices cite:Boehner2007.
In the context of our study, our probe seeks primarily to answer research
questions, rather than to act as a step in an iterative design process. Unlike
some probes in past work, ours was not intended for longitudinal deployment.
Instead, we aimed to gather beliefs about particular technologies and domains
through a session of open-ended interaction with a device cite:Leahu2014.
_TODO something about short study duration / precedent for short-duration probes_

*** Brain-based authentication

As our technology probe, we focused on brain-based authentication as a specific
application to bring to our participants. Brain-based authentication uses neural
signals, detected from a brainscanning device, as a biometric to authenticate
users. This section explains why we picked brain-based authentication as an
application area for our technology probe.

Brain scanning holds a unique /charisma/ cite:Ames2015, not only among
researchers in related fields cite:Rose2016a, but among non-experts as well
cite:Ali2014a. A particularly pervasive facet of brainscanning's charisma is a
reductive neuroessentialism cite:Vries2007,
in which the /brain/ becomes equated with the
/self/. In his study of PET scans, Dumit outlines how the rhetoric around
this scanning methodology spurred utopian (and dystopian) visions of diagnosing
mental illness, or even criminality, from scans of a person's brain
cite:Dumit2004. Dumit raises the question of how notions of /personhood/ become
entangled with the brain through the technical and social affordances of PET's
imagery.

# Richmod:
#  I *think* there's a sort of general fiction, but perhaps interesting, dystopian narrative about the brain and the self that's counter to your charisma. The sort of knowing/linking/scanning the brain as a reduction of "self". (Thinking of the Borg in Star Trek and hive mind fears)

# Introducing passthoughts
Because of this pre-existing entanglement between the brain and the self in
technoscientific discourse, we decided to focus our probe around the same topic.
In the paradigm of brain-based authentication, patterns of brainwaves, however
dynamic, become equated with the selves who produce them, using the statistical
infrastructures of machine learning algorithms. In so doing, the system implies
an equiveilance between the brain (as a physical organ) and the self: From the
perspective of brain-based authentication systems, a person /is/ the way their
brain works. Further, while the brain-based authentication paradigm is explored
by much academic research
cite:Chuang2013b,Marcel2007a,Maiorana2016,Marcel2007a,Thorpe2005, it remains
both ``sci-fi'' enough to trigger the imagination of participants, it is also
vague enough to produce skepticism and concern as to whether the device will be
consistently accurate.

While past work has looked at academic visions around selfhood and the brain
cite:Rose2016a,Sample2016, less is known about how other technical practioners
may understand these notions, or their relation to one another. As research into
brain-based authentication continues cite:merrill2017future, re-examining these
findings from neuroscience and STS among software engineers may also shed light
on novel considerations for design.

We decided to use the InteraXon Muse (Figure [[fig:muse]]) as our physical sensing
device. The Muse is an EEG-sensing headband containing four electrodes, sold
commercially for 249USD. Although the Muse's signal can be contaminated by noise
from muscular movement or environmental radiation, its signal has been robust
enough for use in some neuroscience studies cite:Krigolson2017,Karydis2015, In
our own tests, we found the Muse produced a signal clean enough to provide
robust classification accuracy for the authors. Further, the device is light and
portable, and does not require special gels, making it minimally invasive for
our purposes in designing a probe.

**** Designing the probe: Emulating the debugging experience

# So why brain-based authentication for our study?
# to help surface software engineers' beliefs about the
# self, while focusing discussions on authentication specifically. 
# Specifically,


While the brain-based authenticator probe had a natural thematic relationship to
our research questions, we designed the specific technical artifact to raise the
intended questions (and criticisms) among our participants as they interacted
with it. Software engineers design systems that rest on rule-based reasoning,
yet attuned to the ``edge-cases'' that arise from the messiness of human
realities. Thus, we believe this group would be well-attuned to the limitations
and needs of a technical system design. Although these engineers may be
``caught'' by aspects of the charisma surrounding brain-based systems, they are
also well-equipped to disagnose issue, and surface the consequences of these
systems. In the hopes of triggering our participants' ``professional vision''
cite:Goodwin1994 as software engineers, we designed our probe to mimic the
experience of sitting at one's terminal and debugging (Figure \ref{fig:ui}).
# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# M - One angle: because engineers are used to designing systems that need
# hard-and-fast rules (and to take care of edge cases etc.) for the messiness of
# human realities, they may be better attuned to the issues that could come up,
# whereas non-engineers may not fully understand the limitations and needs of a
# technical system design (e.g. assuming the tech can do more than it actually
# can). In a way, though engineers might be 'caught' by the charisma of these
# systems, maybe they're actually a little *less* susceptible?
# #+END_QUOTE


Our probe's unfinished appearance was intended to invite critique and playful
experimentation. However, unlike a mock-up or provocation, our probe did
function as advertised, allowing participants to interact with the devices in an
exploratory and unconstrained way (indeed, many engineers tested that the
device's feedback was real). We hoped the live nature of the feedback would
encourage subjects to discuss the probabilistic judgments of the system's
machine learning classifier, a technical configuration that has become the
mainstay of modern inherence-based authentication.

# _TODO we do NOT aim to build a representative example of people, or even of engineers........we just require them for these properties we talk about above_.

** Methods

*** Participants

# Recruitment technique & rationale
Our subjects were recruited from Silicon Valley software engineering startups.
Using personal connections and mailing lists, we screen specifically for
subjects We used snowball sampling to reach additional participants who met
these criteria. Historically, these engineers have a outsized impact on the
types of software developed for mass consumer use cite:saxenian1996regional. As
sensor hardware becomes more commercially accessible, and therefore more
amenable to experimentation at the software, this group once again holds a
unique role in devising a consumer future for this biosensor. Due to the
pervasive culture of unstructured experimentation or ``hacking'' within Silicon
Valley technical culture cite:saxenian1996regional, we screened for participants
who expressed an interest in developing BCI equipment as a hobby. We assumed
this group would be more invested in analyzing and critiquing the technology
probe.
# and also more suceptible to its hype, no? how do we counter this critique?

A total of eight people participated, three of which were women. Participants'
ages ranged from 23 to 36. We met with subjects for a single, one-hour session
in which we trained and tested a brain-based authenticator, allowing them to
interact with it in an open-ended way.

# TODO explain why we had subjects record these tasks, even tho we used pure inherence for the CLF laer?
First, participants would wear the device, become acquainted to its fit and
appearance, and confirm the device is working. Next, the experimenter would
begin a calibration session, in which the subjects would be prompted to choose
mental gestures (Table [[tab:tasks]]), and perform them several times. After this
calibration, the experimenter would ask participants to review which mental
gestures they chose. Following this discussion, the interviewer would ask
subjects what their favorite and least favorite tasks were.

After some discussion on why subjects preferred certain tasks over others, the
interviewer would ask, ``Which task do you think would be most unique to you?''
This question, which typically resulted in several follow-ups, was aimed at
learning what subjects believe the device can reveal. The interviewer would
attempt to drill as deeply as possible (without leading subjects) to discuss the
particular mechanisms they believe to be at play. As an example, the researcher
would first ask subjects which tasks they felt might be more unique to them. In
probing why subjects felt this way, the researcher would encourage subjects to
reflect on what the device might really be sensing, and what sort of
``resolution'' it might have. From there, the researcher might ask what any
device (even theoretical ones) might be able to detect.

At this point, the interviewer would train the authenticator's XGBoost cite:Chen2016
classifier on samples collected from the subjects. The interviewer would explain
to participants roughly how the authenticator would work: the probe should
/accept/ readings when the participant is wearing the device, and /reject/
readings in any other case. After the training process completed, the researcher
would set up the UI (Figure \ref{fig:ui}), and allow participants to view the
classifier's output in real-time using live data from the participant's Muse
device. Participants would then see the probe's /accept/ or /reject/
classifications using the live data from their headset.

Free-form exploration ensued, as participants experimented with the device.
During the experimentation phase, if subjects had not attempted to cause the
device to fail already, the interviewer would ask, /``How can you be sure this
device really works?''/ This question was meant to encourage subjects to test
the device's limitations, and to think aloud as they discussed why particular
tests might be informative. The interviewer would then ask subjects to reflect
on the device's limitations, and why such limitations might exist. /``Are these
limitations intrinsic to the physical device? To brain-based authentication?''/

Finally, the interviewer would use the prior conversation to segue into a larger
discussion about brain-based authentication. /``Do you think the brain can be
used to log people in?''/ After some discussion, the interviewer would ask /``In
your own words, what is authentication?''/ This question would occasionally
cause subjects to re-evaluate their prior answer. Finally, the interviewer would
ask subjects what they believed the ``ultimate'' form of authentication might
be. Through follow-up questions, this discussion would typically lead to the
philosophical questions of personhood. /``What makes/ you /you?''/

After some discussion, the formal interview would conclude, and the participants
would remove the Muse device from their head. 

** Results


Participants experiences in using our technology probe as an authenticator were varied.
Four particpants fuond the authenticator worked well for them, consistently accepting their readings when they were wearing the headset
and consistently rejected readings when the headset was taken off, or when the experimenter was wearing it.
On the other hand, four particpants found the authenticator did not work reliably for them. In two cases, the authenticator constantly rejected particpants regardless of whether it was on or off.
In the other two cases, the authenticator consistantly gave mixed or ambiguous feedback when particpants wore it.

Regardless of the probe's accuracy, its ability to function at did lead subjects to discuss how the system could work, and how it would map to notions of identity.
The remainder of this section outlines how such conversations emerged,
and reviews participants' major beliefs about the ground truth for identity.

*** Failure modes.

Discussions about the nature of the self often started with discussions about
how the authentication scheme might fail. In some cases, these limitations were
perceived as cheiefly relating to the system's implementation. For example, one
subject mentioned an opacity intrinsic to the black box algorithm used to
perform the authentication.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We don't know it's not working until it's not working. If something is
inaccurate, sometimes 20% and sometimes 5%, there is uncertainty about what
you dont know, not knowing what you dont know. /(Elizabeth)/
#+END_QUOTE

Here, Elizabeth refers to the difficulty of knowing when a false acceptance has
occurred in such a system, and difficulty correcting for these mistakes. She
draws this difficulty to a fundamental lack of information about possible inputs
into the algorithm. We return to these notions of opacity, and their possible
consequences, in the discussion. Other subjects brought up other possible
shortcomings of the authentication scheme stemming from the changing nature of
the brain.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In cases of severe trauma or damage, like someone who drowns and is deprived of
oxygen for some amount of time, or if you go through some major life trauma
that's really awful, that can potentially change the brain. /(John)/
#+END_QUOTE

When asked whether it would be appropriate for a brain-based authenticator to
reject a participant in such a situation, John reported that it would be.
``Maybe that's colored by my - I work with computers, and I think that's a
reasonable way for a system like this to work.'' Alex raised a similar point
about brain changes affecting authentication, and also indiciated that it might
be reasonable for the system to reject a user in such a case.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It's a constantly changing fingerprint, so we have to continually update that...
If the changes are so drastic, should you be allowed to access your bank
account? When you take that acid trip, and - I had this big, life-changing trip
and I can't log into shit anymore. ``I'm a better person, I tell you!'' /(Alex)/
#+END_QUOTE

In both of these examples, the changing nature of the brain
brings difficulties for using the brain as a stable identifier.
However, John did not indicate the changing brain would indicate a
changing /person/. Instead, the system would reject the new person because
of its reliance on the brain, and in spite of the fact that their personhood did not change.
In contrast, Alex posits a scenario in which a transformative life event does change
some aspect of his identity, making him a ``better person.''
We return to these complementary meanings of a changing brain in the discussion.

*** Relationship between passthoughts and identity

To nudge subjects toward discussions about selfhood and its relation to
biometric identifiers, the experiment would typically use discussions about the
device's shortcomings or limitations to ask how a better system might work that
overcomes these limitations. In so doing, the experimenter would ask subjects to
draw comparisons between passthoughts and other authentication methods, both
traditional (e.g. passwords or car keys) and inherence-based (e.g.
fingerprints).

**** Skepticism

All subjects expressed a high degree of skepticism that the passthoughts system
we presented them could reveal identity in any true way. However, the reasons
they gave for this skepticism were various.

Following Dumit's work on the neuroessentialist belief that the nature of
identity is fundamentally in the mind cite:Dumit2004, we expected subjects to
believe passthoughts captured some truer token of identity as compared to other
biometric or authentication paradigms. To our surprise, only one subject, Joanna,
believed passthoughts captured something close to selfhood (discussed further
under ``Self as brain,'' below). Interestingly, this subject had an academic background in neuroscience prior to her career as an engineer. However, informed by her training, she felt that current scanning machines had signals too noisy to reliable detect neural correlates of identity ``anytime soon.''

Other subjects gave more existential reasons for doubting that passthoughts
meaningfully captured selfhood. For example, Alex felt that the EEG-derived
authentication tokens were ``basically a string'' (e.g., a string of chracters,
a common datatype in programming languages), and in this way similar to
passwords. Alex's implication here is that the resulting string is crackable,
and effectively a knowledge factor (to authenticate, one must only know a string
that makes the authenticator output an /accept/ label). Alex felt brain-based
authentication schemes has little to do with identity for this reason.

Joe also sidestepped questions of identity in referring to the way passthoughts
works. In contrast to Alex, however, Joe found the brain-based signals to 
be simple ``learned responses,'' not tokens that meaningfully relate to a person's identity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think it's just a learned response kind of thing, completely orthogonal to
general questions of identity. You know, if I take 1000 pictures of you, track
what you smell like, I guess that's latching on to some aspect of a fundamental
``you,'' but I'm not sure that reflects who you are... /(Joe)/
#+END_QUOTE

Joe's analogy to photos and scents gesture toward the piecemeal nature of
current biometric identifiers. Aspects of body are taken as evidence for
personhood, which may ``latch onto some aspect of'' personhood, but does not
reflect it in an essential way. (Joe later expressed that ``mining'' a true self
is impossible, discussed further below).

**** Biological identity beyond the brain

While some participants did believe our brain-based authentication mechanism
related to selfhood, these participants did not generally believe our
brain-based scheme was particularly unique. Terrance, for example, compared our
scheme favorably to that of ``trust in some social institution.'' Although he
did not specify which particular institutions he had in mind, he mentioned
social security numbers, birth names and credit card numbers as other examples
of authentication tokens. Though Terrance believed brain-based tokens were
``more fundamental'' than these identifiers, he did not believe they were
uniquely well-suited to revealing selfhood, except that they were difficult for
people to control directly.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I can't even influence my brainstates, so how's someone else supposed to do it?
But again, any organ like that would be equally good. /(Terrance)/
#+END_QUOTE

On one hand, notions of control gesture toward
the possibility for coercion (i.e. forcing someone to reveal their authentication
token), a point we return to in the discussion.
On the other, the notion of the brain's non-specialness (i.e., that other sources of data could also be used to establish personhood, so long as they met particular criteria)
mirrors in other subjects relational/longitudinal views of identity (below).
We return to the consequences of such beliefs in ``Implications for Design.''

# _may make more sense to introduce this quote AFTER we introduce terrance's idea of the self as a social construct_

*** The ``ground truth'' of identity

Discussions about the relationship of passthoughts' implementation to the ground
truth of identity caused many subjects to reflect on their own beliefs about
identity. Mary explicitly did /not/ feel the brain was the source of identity.
In fact, she called out and critiqued popular narratives around brain's
uniqueness:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There is some special social narrative put on the brain, right. That the brain is, to use this phrase, the seat of your soul, and all that stuff. So I think that at scale, most people would ascribe some sort of significance to the brain, as a vector for this authentication mechanism generation - whereas I might not. But that's also just because I know - I think - that the brain is not any more special than like any other part. /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

_So much for uncritical engineers!_
Some subjects, such as Joe, refused to commit to particular notions of
selfhood, stating such notions were impossible to ``mine.''
# interestingly, joanna, who mostly felt the brain *was* the seat of identity, had a bg in neuroscience!!! so this 'popular narrative' also applied to her - maybe she is more neuroessentialist, as dumit would say, than engineers on the whole? pt for discussion
# more in discussion about this, about how past work maybe more limited to neuroscientists than previously thought

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We will never be able to mine the base of the self... I could record all my thoughts, my experiences, and plop someone into it, but there's no way to experimentally verify that it is my experience.
#+END_QUOTE

Joe raises a difficult epistemological problem in verifying that a given
experience is truly what some other person experiences _(probably this has
precedent in philosph. should look for refs)_. However, implicit here is the
belief that experiences and thoughts do equate with selfhood, gesturing toward a
notion of selfhood expressed within the individual. On the other hand, some
subjects posited a more social, relational view of selfhood. 
Mary referred instead posited a relational, social notion of ``true'' idenity, one with no particular relation to the body. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I know this is not convenient for your brain thing, but I feel it's more actions... It's interesting, I went home a few months ago... When I go to Kanasas, no one thinks I'm charming. Everyone things I'm this realy type A, super intense individual. But here [in San Francisco], people say I'm charming. /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

Mary's continued to explain that the true nature of self depended on where you
were, and with whom you were interacting, drawing on her father's tendancy
toward shyness around people he did not know well. 
John proposed a similar explanation.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Your self is almost informed by other people, and the way they see you, and the way you see them, and the way you experience things throughout your life. I don't think it's spirtual thing, I think it's more like you've been writing in this journal for a really long time, and if you read it, all the way to the very end, the self is like the takeaway at the very end. /(John)/
#+END_QUOTE

Both John and Mary refer to the longitudinal and dynamic nature of identity,
and implictly contested notions that a true or essential self might be derived from the body.
The experimenter asked both subjects whether a system that detects their notion of identity could exist.
Both expressed that it could, and in some sense, already did.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The actions you take, the jobs you go to, the people you are interacting with, that is now, for the first time in history, written down in minutae. You can say, ``this person's fingerprints are completely worn off,'' but you could predict if it's the same person based on their future actions. /(Mary)/
#+END_QUOTE

Drawing on the language of ubiquitous data collection, Mary referred to her own experiences as an engineer
in making her aware of how pervasive such data collection is.
Her vision of selfhood as captured in these ``minutae'' speaks to many existing theories
of internet privacy 
_like what??? why bring theories up at all, incl goffman - if these folks don't know about those theories, why mention them at all, esp in the results (vs discussion)?_.

*** Dissenting views

**** Self as brain

Two participants gave different views on the ground truth for identity.
One participant, Joanna, offered a brain-based and biological explanation for the mind.
Joanna felt that the brain was a truer source of identity than
other parts of the body, though she noted that current devices, consumer and
research-grade, were too crude to capture such an identity meaningfully.

Joanna believed that the brain was the essential nature of the self.
Though the brain ``encountered input'' from the body and world,
it was the brain's ``processing'' of this input that gave rise to a self.
In her explanation, Joanna drew on both her academic training as a neuroscientist,
and also on her personal experiences with friends and family suffering from mental illness.
She believed that changes to the brain during mental illnesses caused fundamental changes,
such that these people were different selves.

Interestingly, this subject was formerly trained as a neuroscientist, a group
whose beliefs about the brain and self have been well-studied in the past cite:Dumit2004,Vries2007.
The fact that Joanna's beliefs were quite different from the other software
engineers in our study raises intereting questions about how other technical
practioners might encounter notions of selfhood, or the brain, and how these
beliefs may manifest in a future of more pervasive brain-computer interfaces. We
return to this point in the discussion.


**** No true self

Another participant, Terrance did not believe the self existed in any real or
true way. He believed that ``there is no fundamental difference between the self
and the rest of the world'' and that selves are defined ``by convention'' in
social circumstances. Specifically, he believed engineers such as himself
actively create such conventions through the artifacts they build.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Even if there's no logical bottom [to identity], we will create one.... we will find a way /(Terrance)/.
#+END_QUOTE

Terrance's response here gestures toward a reflexivity of his own role as an
engineer, a view in which entities in the world are actively shaped through
technical practices. At the same time, Terrance's response indicates a level of
determinism, or resignation, that notions of selves will continue to feed
themselves forward through technical artifacts. We return to this point in the
discussion.

** Discussion

# Engineers' subject position
This study focused on the beliefs of software engineers. We found that these engineers were
well-positioned to be critical about the technical artifact we showed them. The
system's highly technical interface and only semi-reliable performance
encouraged them to enter their professional mindset as engineers, as they
actively prodded at both the device and the ideas it embedded.

In their _critical?_ interactions with our probe, participants generally
acknowledged their unique subject position as engineers, either in their
unflattering perspective on large-scale data collection practices, in their
immunity to popular narratives around the brain, or in their reflexivity about
their ability to construe concepts in the world through the creation of
technical artifacts (e.g. terrance thought self didnt exist, would keep getting
made as engineers ``found a way'').

# future work?
To our surprise, we did not encounter the ``neuroessentialst'' view of
self-as-brain found in prior work on neuroscientists cite:Dumit2004,Vries2007 except
with one subject who had academic training in neuroscience. Prior work focusing
on academic neuroscientists may not translate to technical practioners
generally. As BCIs become more commercially accessible, and thus more amenable
to experimentation by non-neuroscientists, future work should critically
re-evaluate past work on academic BCI, with a particular sensitivity toward the
consequences that beliefs about selfhood might have for technical practice.
Since most emerging BCI technologies emerge from academic neuroscience
cite:Dumit2004,Vries2007, designers and researchers should be careful not to assume
that past studies on the beliefs of neuroscientists will generalize to other
technical communities.

# _so what? why does this ^ help us w our RQs?_
The remainder of this discussion aims to trace through the main conceptions of
self/identity we uncovered during our study. In the following section, we use
these notions of selves to motivate future designs for authentication systems.

*** Various selfhoods

We present here notions of identity that are potentially overlapping, such that
no catagory implies a whole or totalizing belief on the part of our
participants. Rather, we acknowledge that each of these beliefs left room for
one another. We often encountered a coexistence of these beliefs among our
participants.

**** Dynamic selves

In evaluating passthoughts, participants typically grappled with the reality of a brain that changes over the course of one's life.
Through their reflection on this topic, participants expressed a belief that people themselves change over time, 
contrasting with traditional inherence-based tokens, which are explicitly designed to be static throughout a person's life cite:Bonneau2012.
# though no one committed to particular causal theories with regard to changes in the brain.
  
**** Relational selves

Four of our subjects expressed a belief that selves change depending on context,
particularly where a person is and with whom that person is interacting.
(Though subjects did not discuss it as such, these beliefs relate somewhat
somewhat to Irving Goffman's dramataleurgical analysis of social behavior as performance cite:Goffmann1959).
_slice the goffman ref, or unpack and make relevant to design_
In any case, these beliefs contrast with inherence-based authentication tokens,
which are by design insensitive to contextual conditions.

**** Data selves

In describing something that maps closely to a ground truth of selfhood,
three subjects referred to the aggregate of all digitally captured data over time.
These participants often made analogies to written records in explaining this connection (John explicitly mentioned a ``journal,'' where the self is ``the takeaway at the end'').
This notion of a selfhood-through-data relate to some past work in quantified self cite:Nafus2016, though this work focuses more on self-tracking practices than authentication in particular.
We return to this connection to past work in the following section.

**** No selves

Two of our participants believed the self was an untenable construct, either because they believed it was not real (Terrance) or impossible to verify experimentally (Joe).
However, Terrance believed that notions of self could (and will) be constructed by engineers.
In the following section, we discuss further what it might be like to build an authentication mechanism that does not make commitments about sefhood.

** Implications for design

In our discussion, we surfaced tensions between what inherence authentication
does (i.e., verify personhood), and what authentication systems would have to do
in order to classify /personhood as engineers understand it/. In reflecting on
these tensions, we present here some possible designs more ammenable to the
notions of selfhood we surfaced in our study. We quickly explain each method,
and describe how such a system may motivate future research.

# EWA LUGER

# Through our technology probe, which relied on markers from the brain, we found
# no indication that existing tokens of inherence (e.g. the face, fingerprints)
# map well to software engineers' beliefs about the nature of the self. 

*** Sort of interesting to me

_Here's some stuff that's sort of interesting to me, some work already speaks to it. I feel I should talk about in the interest of mapping sense of self to alternative authentication technologies._

**** Social authentication

_motivate with discussion_
  - participants felt self had to do with how you interact around others

_quick explanation from sec lit_ 
- socially contextual authentication, who you are around and who knows you cite:Das2017

_why/how interesting for design/future work_
- could help map to *diff* notions of selfhood and autonomy, e.g. in cultures where family or community autonomy is emphasized over individual autonomy cite:ur2013cross.

**** Continuous, multimodal authentication

_motivate with discussion_
  - views of self as dynamic, captured in longitudinal data
  - relational, action-oriented, based on /what you do/ rather than /what you are/.
  - mary gestured toward existing systems of massive data collection,
  - Terrance gestures toward ``control,'' difficult to control is good (like brain)
 
_quick explanation from sec lit_ 
  - "what you do" .. all sorts of data, all digital traces
  - en masse used to distinguish you from others

_why/how interesting design/future work_ 
  - plays with privacy, tension between privacy and security (autonomy), similar to what we play with here using our "mind-reading" probe
  - Algorithmic opacity/transparency came up
    - significance to continuous auth, which is almost always probabilistic _[TODO comb thru those prob/continous auth pdfs]_

*** Real interesting to me 

_Here's a concept I'm really interested in, no work out there on it that I know of._

**** Authentication without the self

_motivate with discussion_
- Terrance didn't believe self was real, ``no logical bottom''
- Joe thought self could not be verified

_how/why interesting for design/future work_
- Think hard about whether auth systems should even care about the self
  - Is (bodily) selfhood even something we want or need?
  - Could reference Proudhon's ``invention of the self,'' a technology that makes markets work
- What would it look like to provide authentication without a sense of personhood?

  - Passwords are like that, just about access!

  - Other things that are similar? Possession factors e.g.?

  - Group-based authentication, questions primacy of individual?
  
  - Systems with no static identities, only changing psuedonyms _[must be prior work on this]?_

- What upsides, why apealing beyond theory?

  - For research?

  - For probing beliefs?

  - For questioning dominant assumptions about what computer security should acheive / accomplish?

*** Selfhood beyond authentication

# _can just raise the Q and throw out some examples, future work after all_.
For what other applications is personhood is relevant? Personhood in software beyond authentication?
- captchas that are behavior based?...
- profiling systems, e.g. recidivism?...
- Implications of this work for those systems?
  - _TODO what designers can be sensitive to/how.._
  - _TODO blurring of the line btwn systems that track behavior + systems that track identity....?.......hmmmmmmmmmmmm...........kind of interesting no??_

** Future work

While our probe succeeded in surfacing beliefs about personhood, our study was
limited by the short duration of our probe. Our sensing device did not have the
battery life to record for several hours, and we experienced intermittent
connectivity issues when walking outdoors. A device now available
cite:Optical2017 would allow us to deploy a future probe over hours or days,
enabling a study in which participants could build a meaningful relationship
with the device over time and in the context of everyday life cite:Gaver1999.

# _history of auth / ID, assoc of self. talking about inherence and possession to get to self. st interesting about .... SSNs, not initially IDs, now they are, social construction of what ID is .... [would save for disc about persons and property]_

One interesting direction for future work could be comparative between engineers and non-engineers, looking at the origins of any differences that arise.
_more...?_

_longitudinal data selves, what about china's social credit system? private-sector surveillance on the net as selfhood, alternative to state-given identity? HMMMMM now thats an interesting one._

** Conclusion

- Authentication and property / Authentication in society?
  - Authentication's primary role in controls access to property?
  - biological identity / consequences of these beliefs, wrt property, access to services, criminality. talking to the ppl who build these consequential systems. a motivation for a whole new paper

* Conclusion

_surveillance, simone browne, about power_

_so i went through nitpicking all these theories, but......_
_what can we add to conversation that will substantially help to address these critiques across much research?_

_High level takeaways from this discussion section_.
_Answer the paper's question: what are the limits?_.

# Many issues are endemic to this field of study (e.g. establishing ground truth
# for a detected emotional response cite:Healey2011,Hernandez2013). 

*** Brainscanning, autonomy, control

# TODO how to tie into above concerns about interpretability?

# re: "information"
# paul - In looking at that concept in the 18th century, I was intrigued _how the term developed to include factual propositions that we consider consciously_.  
# paul - These are particularly the sort of things that might feature in political discussions—and hence information has been valued as a key ingredient of the public sphere.  
# paul - But 18th century accounts also presented _information as the signals sent through the nerves to which the brain responds beneath consciousness_ and so was feared as a _means of shaping that consciousness beyond our control_ —the very thing that could undermine the public sphere.  
# paul - The 18c philosophers saw that aspect as particularly worrying.  
# paul - It seemed to me that you work embraces both.  
# paul - So, as you probe your informants, I do suggest trying to understand how they see these issues.  
# paul - On the one hand, _brain signals seem to give us a particular autonomy if no one can imitate our unique identity_.
# paul - On the other, _they subject us to the power of signals over which we have no control, and so lose a certain autonomy_.
#
# > I agree that there is a fundamental tension in this work between autonomy (via "unforgeable" identity that matches our conscious sense of selfhood) on one hand,
# > and the power for control, especially by probing knowledge subliminally on the other.
# > I will add that, in the current study, subjects were highly skeptical that the device *did* get at some ground truth of identity.
# > they largely reported a more interactional account of identity, in which personhood shifts depending on context, actions, and time. (much to my surprise!)
# > so, perhaps it's all downside for them (control), and no upside (autonomy)?

*** TODO A future for privacy and cybersecurity

 now with VR even more intimate 
 bci promises yet another intimacy, 
   look at those side-channel attacks and so on, 
   done with P300 and now there's a startup with a P300 api [], once the stuff of fiction []
