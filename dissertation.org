#+Title: Essays on Mind-Reading Machines
#+Author: Nick Merrill

# the surprisingly great show on the end of the world
# when her leg was over me stroking my arm
# i wanted to be completely present in that moment. i wanted to be nowhere else.Â 

# (i didn't want to freeze time, i didn't want to be there forever, i just wanted to be there.)
# though walking around the side of the observatory seeing LA around, walking past the people looking off the edge taking pictures, i was truly there then. the world was no louder than the sounds it was making.

* How to Read a Mind
* Technical Barriers to Mind-Reading Machines
* Case study: Authentication
** 'read mind' in the sense of seeing that you really are you
** establish that such a thing is possible
*** with inherence
*** with knowledge
** call out epistemelogical commitments of brain-base authenticator
*** diff notions of self have diff consequences for the way an authenticator can be said to 'work'!
*** describe diversion we are about to take
**** first we take a diversion to discuss social aspects of mind reading machines
**** then we establish people DO have mind-reading meanings to basic biosigansl
**** having done that, we return to brain-bbased authentication & interpretation
* Social aspects of mind-reading machines
** have an intrinsically social component
*** in that we decide the ground truth labels
*** and these labels take on indeterminate meanings in various contexts
** motivate next two empirical chapters
*** first, establish people DO have mind-reading meanings to basic biosignals
*** having done that, return to brain-based authentication & interpretations there
* Users' interpretations of basic biosignals
  People already think biosignals can reveal about the mind
copy&paste group&cscw papers (minimally just evidence)
* Designers' interpretations of EEG
copy&paste chi in whatever future form
* Conclusions
