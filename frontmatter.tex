\begin{abstract}
What can machines know about the mind, even theoretically? This dissertation
discusses what people (end-users and software engineers)
\textit{believe} the answers to this question might be through two main cases. 
First, qualitative and quantitative data show how particular social contexts
meet with prior beliefs about the body to produce mind-related meanings around
basic biosignals such as heartrate. Second, a working brain-computer interface
probes the diverse beliefs engineers hold about the mind, and their united
belief that the mind is readable by machines. Together, these cases surface an
unstable boundary between sensing bodies and sensing minds. I propose this
boundary as a site for studying futures of computer-mediated communication, of
security, privacy and surveillance, and futures of minds themselves.

%% As biosensors creep into smart watches, bands, and ingestibles, they
%% will build increasingly high resolution models of bodies in space. Their ability
%% to divine not just what these bodies do, but what they think and feel, presents
%% an under-explored avenue for understanding and imagining the role these
%% technologies will play in everyday life.

Thanks to John Chuang for being a mentor in every sense of the word, for taking
me on in this ancient model of apprenticeship, and showing me how the work is
done. During my time as a PhD student, John put together BioSENSE, a group that
made my dissertation possible. A few BioSENSors in particular helped me
immensely: Coye Cheshire, with whom I did much of the work in this dissertation,
and fellow students (and extended cohort members) Richmond Wong, and Noura
Howell. Outside of BioSENSE, Alva NoÃ« raised excellent points about the
relationship between the work and the other, related debates that were hiding in
plain site. Along the way, Paul Duguid taught me a great deal about what good
scholarship looks like.

Above all, I would like to thank my mom and dad, who always believed in the
importance of my work, even when they weren't quite sure what my work was.

I would also like to thank Chihei Hatakeyama and Hakobune for the peaceful music.
