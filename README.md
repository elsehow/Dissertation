# dissertation

my dissertation at the uc berkeley school of information

## prerequisites

you will need [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to compile anything

### OS X

for pdf output, you'll also need LaTeX. 

installing [mactex](http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) will work out of the box on OSX.

but, you may need to add the relavent bins to your path:

    export PATH=$PATH:/Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/texbin
