<p>Biosensing technologies are becoming pervasive in our daily lives, beyond wristwatches and eyeglasses, into clothing, furniture, mirrors, cars, personal robots, ingestibles. These technologies will enable us to build increasingly high-resolution models of our bodies in the wild, outside of laboratory settings. New algorithms will transform our understanding of the body, yielding.........</p>
<p>But, as data from these biosensors become available to designers, we must ask: How will <em>humans</em> interpret data from these biosesnors? Take Apple Watch, which allows users to transmit their heartrate socially, beat by beat, to a friend. When are users supposed to do this? What are they supposed to learn from the data they transmit? In both cases, the applications imply intimacy. Is this the only thing biosensors are capable of expressing?</p>
<p>While a large body of research explores what algorithms can learn from biosensors, it is not well understood how people derive meaning from the same signals, or how these meanings change in different social contexts. <strong>What is the expressive capacity of biosensors and biosignals?</strong> This question is essential for understanding the privacy and security needs that will come and biosensors become increasingly ubiquitous.</p>
<!-- information about another person under risk and uncertainty 
    abt non-health stuff - mood,thoughts,emotion
-->
<p>I will perform controlled, lab-based behavioral experiments, as well as survey experiments, in which subjects partake in risky, uncertain interactions with other people (e.g., the money they receive depends on their behavior). Subjects will be exposed, or not exposed, to a biosignal collected from their partner. By introducing signals such as GSR, heart rate and EEG into classic social- behavioral experimental paradigms (e.g., dictator game, iterated prisoner's dilemma game), or into vignette scenarios, we can begin to observe how the presence of biosignals affects social behavior, as compared to control conditions.</p>
<p>Through these studies, I hope to shed some light on how interpretations arise from biosensor data. The very big questions here -- how these interpretations depend on the sensor, the application context, the phenomenon being sensed -- begin to gesture toward the huge mosaic of factors at play in this question. I hope that this very fundamental series of studies opens the dialogue around privacy as they bare on wearable sensors. Data, even raw data that may seem innocuous to end users, can have <em>contextual</em> social effects that are far from obvious.</p>
<p>Applications that leverage wearable biosensor data will change the way we relate to our bodies, and to the bodies of others, in ways we do not yet understand. These studies will provide a limited, but useful starting point for understanding how, why, and when disclosure of biosignals might become relevant. We hope to shed light on how these signals are incorporated into our understandings of the moods, motivations, and goals of other people, which in turn will lay groundwork for a deeper understanding of how wearable data might become sensitive, or might lead to over-disclosure, in different settings and contexts.</p>

<p>I will analyze the first part of my CHI 2016 submission, giving it the proper dissertation (rather than ACM) treatment, and diving a bit more into how the less-trust-given-high-heartrate narrative is surprising in the context of past work on heartrate sharing with wearables, but not surprising in the context of past work on perceptions of heartrate generally.</p>

<li>Vignette experiment with heartrate</li>

<p>This experiment, the second part of my CHI 2016 submission, offers a nice contrast to the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, and it begins to draw out themes for how the contextual meaning of signals might &quot;matter&quot; for social behavior.
