<p>A lot of work looks at what biosensor data means to algorithms, but what do these data mean to people? Through three studies, this dissertation examines how humans (rather than algorithms) encounter and interpret biosensor data in social contexts.</p>

<p>heartrate in apple watch has algorithmic meanings <span class="citation">(Latvala et al. 2015)</span> but im more interested in thumbkisses <span class="citation">(McNell 2015)</span> what is it that allows this to work? what are the affordances of thumbkisses as opposed to just two circles where you're pressing ont he screen? (higher-resolution models of our bodies in everyday life).</p>
<p>heartrate sharing in everyday life <span class="citation">(Slovák, Janssen, and Fitzpatrick 2012)</span> and how there are social meanings but how do they arise? are these meanings always positive?</p>
<p>stakeholders are designers + ppl who &quot;buy&quot; sensor readings.</p>
