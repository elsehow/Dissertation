## general notes

when drafting, JUST TYPE
when outlining, ok think
nothing gets slick until index.md 

also, *everything* slick =>> index.md
once something strong - structure, content - index.md



## mechanical

how can i include files within files?
nested structure would be reeaaaaaallllly nice, with 1 index source file to rule it all......wowwe. v granular

what i would do is, make 1 markdown for each bit, then merge into a big markdown, then merge all the markdowns. wow

basically, i would recursively walk each folder in src, make its Makefile in a depth-first fashion.....until we get to the root!
hmmmm
