* DONE notes
** TODO but wait.....................
but, also want to know how ppl /actually act in vivo/
and how UNCONSCIOUS influence can exert itself in sensing contexts....
im thinking of the depression micro-intervention thing

representation, or presence of UI, has an effect..........
** DONE johns notes

> why asking these questions? bc surveillance

context is, im at home
bunch of devices, not even wearables, capable of collecting biosignals in the home (everyone in the home). imagine, these devices not connected to cloud. the "intranet of things" 

how do i share or negotiate shairng with my wife?
intranet of things -sure, i'm happy- once we introduce another person an elderly parent, it gets less ideal.........becomes a question of tradeoffs

if light changes with heartrate, but has to go to fitbit in between, i say forget it

*** three things, two i dont care about 
**** mental model of how data flows
**** why i'd consent to give to my friend but not fitbit
**** TODO DO CARE about what these data MEAN
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why and in what way are they not just totally innocuous
"risk"

*** DONE look at economics of privacy
alexandro aquisti
not to go into this area
a couple papers you want to cite
basically pepole have found, they will over-discount risks that are either (a) unknown (b) uncertain (c) far into the future

*** outcomes
shed light on both 
- both how to build apps
- and privacy/consent outcomes


*** how people interpret the data
not just limited to looking at a screen
there is some overlap with elaine's concerns about sharing between devices
some of the questions speak to each other

*** specific methods + studies
general direction is clear
you are pretty clear on this direction
by "direction" i mean "north" (not sure if im going to redding or seattle)
but, i have something more specific? hard to say

worth you trying to figure out something more specific
types of studies
> methods (survey & lab based psych studies)?
i meant studies but methods is just as impt, arguably more
either way, whatever's easier to think about
** DONE will help us in two ways:
*** TODO to produce new kinds of delightful interactions
(?)
*** DONE to better gauge people's sense of risk
this way, we can understand people's models of *risk*
why would they be sensitive to anyone
why are they /not/ just totally innocuous?
we are understanding this to understand's people's sense of "risk"
** DONE brief introduction to my topic synthesized from webpage.....
not, "why do we consent to upload sensitive information",
/why + how are biosignals sensitive?/
*** initial
**** DONE summary
This dissertation focuses on how *people* (as opposed to algorithms) interpret data from wearable & environmental biosensors, and how these interpretations affect social behavior.
What can these data say about you? What can they say about someone else?
**** DONE detailed explanation
Based on past work on the human interpretation of sensor data [], and on work already done [], we expect these interpretations to vary depending on context. This dissertation focuses on how four specific factors correlate with people's interpretations of biosignal data:

(1) the way in which interfaces represent a given singal 
(2) social context (relationships to, or beliefs about, the person being sensed)
(3) beliefs about the capabilities of algorithms 
(4) beliefs about the physical phenomenon being sensed
**** DONE closer (?)
One very large question this dissertation aims to answer is, /how is it that biosignals take on any meaning at all/?
Why, and when, do biosignals seem anything but innocuous?
So, each bit of experimental work in my dissertation will, in one way or another,
interrogate people's beliefs about the risk associated with disclosure of biosignals,
examining how these beliefs relate to the above factors.
** TODO find that smbc "gosh grandma youre so old fashioned"
first page of my dissertation
** TODO summarize topic briefly
* DONE my intellectual history
<2016-02-01 Mon 13:00>
** DONE not a lot of work on transmitting biosignals socially

*** papers that have done it are gods-eye, like pentland

*** only a few talk about what happens when you show stuff back to the people being sensed

*** (ironic given pentlands focus on harmonious orgnaizations, but thats a differnet matter)

**** he is very dodgy about what kinds of feedback work to /create/ good organizational conditions

**** i guess his job is descriptive...

** DONE ok, but why do we want to know what people make of other people's biosignals?

*** it's a way of discovering what /people make of the signals overall/

*** a way of determining their risk, and of understanding patterns of disclosure

*** after all, why do biosignals tell you anything at all about another person?

** DONE complex interactions between the meaning of signal itself, and way it is represented by the interface

*** signal itself - complex web of cultural meanings

**** cultural, likely

**** experiences with ones own body, likely

**** we dont really need to untangle this web

*** way it is represented by the interface

**** same signal may look more or less risky

***** raw data, not so risky

***** interpreted data, maybe slightly less sure

**** almost a consumer rights issue

***** companies can represent data in a way that makes them seem less risky to disclose/share

***** unless we know what their algorithms tell them, we cant know our own risk

***** "unknown signals" and all that

***** i bet people undervalue the threat of unknown signals
* DONE my justification for doing this
** why do we care what people make of biosensor data?

** beause we turn it into an interface problem

*** rather than a technical one

** and we can approach it on psychological and behavioral terms

** and we want to do this for a few reasons

*** safer, more sensitive apps

*** maybe more fun apps

*** my big 1: DISCLOSURE

**** almost a consumer protection issue
* DONE work done
** 1. experimental study with coye
*** taught us biosignals can affect trusting behavior
** 2. vignette study with coye
*** taught us negative emotional attributes => positive social behaviors
* DONE empirical goals 
** TODO split synthesizing findings up into higher-level argument chunks
** [#B] synthesizing findings
*** one piece done...socially contextual signals..
**** in vignette, high heartrate ==> less trust
**** in experiment, high heartrate==> more trust
**** different things different contexts
*** so, biosignals are richly contexutal, like all other signals in CMC
**** past work has indicated the same is true for signals like GPS  
**** but past work on biosensor applications have largely missed this;
**** heartrate UX in particular seems stuck on "intimacy"
*** BUT,,,different...COMPLEX interactions with /cultural beliefs about the body/...
**** so much interesting work on this with hr
**** famous Valens study
**** describe one some
*** "these interpretations do not necessarily match emprical properties of the signal. they are not based on them, and often do not reference them."
**** compare valens findings to empirical reality of sweden study 
**** these interpretations are a /complex web/
***** of both /social and cultural beliefs/,  
***** and /reasoning by analogy to lived bodily experiences/
**** no way to really untangle the web
***** and i don't try to, 
***** i only want to show that interpretations /are the result of something beyond the way interfaces represent them/
***** indeed, that they are different from other kinds of ambiguous sensor data
*** TODO with this understanding we can begin to assess
**** assess both how an interface affects "risk"
**** and how the signal itself may be seem risky
**** in any case we learn about disclosure a little
**** really, we just want to know WHY and HOW biosignals come to mean anything at all
**** any kind of understanding will help us understand how, why, and when people consent to biosurveillance
*** TODO the representation of the data has a tight reltionship with how risky people think it is to disclose
**** if i show you the raw....youll say it means nothing...if i show you some judgemetns...maybe you're less sure... 
**** meaning as defend by sesnitivity
the social meaning of biosignals - 

** done - that biosignals can affect social behavior
*** and in counter-intuitive ways
*** highly contextual, rich like other cues in CMC
** to start - independent effect of a biosignal (vs. its representation)
*** try to show the independent effect of the signal itself, 
**** we control for different forms of represntation by interfaces
**** then, we see some effect is left over, 
** attitudes about disclosure
the riskiness of the signal itself, how much /sensitive/ information it /seems/ to contain
*** measuring riskiness of disclosure
**** sensitivity of data measured by / willingness to disclose to various parties
**** and im sure theres past work on that measure...  aquisti... 

* DONE a brainstorm for outline

if you can demonstrate this
with more than one example
that could even be a  "headline"  result 
from dissertation book 

a claim, a hypothesis, an argument you are making
making argument from 1 picture is suggestive
from 2-3, this *pattern* we see repeat
> /a pattern with regards to risk/, with how people disclose biosignals
whether heartrate, breathing data, eeg
whether 1 person or 2 persons

what about wiggly line?
showing a wiggly line,,,doesnt appear to have some significant patterns

wiggly line (over time) versus snapshot view.... can people be tricked?

continous stream seems more scary?

you showed me graph - hey, if people just see raw signals, they may say oh its nothing

i'm curious if there's a similar dynamic in heartrate study
where you can show RAW or COLORS or TEXT
....
them making the decision,,,,to trust/cooperate


if yous howed people just the raw data
would they REALLY not trust the other person?

follow up study could say
does matter way in which data was presented
if it's presented in some other way, effect may reduce, disappear, be magnified

if by interpreting it less, we make it more innocuous....

we're interested in a group that already seems happy to disclose, and likely have a high intrinsic motivation to do so. so, why are some people disclosing more sensor data than others, even within this highly motivated group? what is the relationship between their disclosure decisions, and what they think the data might say about them? (e.g., how risky this data is to disclose, risk if there were a data leak, etc..)
**** TODO suggestion from a sensor

ellen says,
i'm thinking one of the big outcomes could be criticizing visualizations + data models
teaching that to high schoolers
> miscategoriztion of moods....
using large datasets
reflective learning.....what if you leveraged emotional ... ?
