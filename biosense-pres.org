* if you look at the raw breathing data over time, 
** asked someone  
*** how risky to disclose?
*** how much it says about you?
** probably say "whatever"
* now, if you showed interpreted data (aclm, focused, etc...) 
** may still say i'ts not so risky to disclose, 
*** but maybe they'd be slightly less sure.....
** so, perception of risk 
*** tightly connected to way signal is represented
* this is almost a consumer rights issue
** companies can represent data 
*** in ways that makes them seem less risky to disclose/share
**** unless we know what the company's algorithms tell them
***** we cant know our own risk
* risk must relate *both* to interface + *sensing* mechanism
** the mechanism itself could play a big role!
*** on the body or not on the body?
* different "affordances" of HR versus EEG
** hard to tell /why/ this is
* in fact, meaning is inextricable from its representation, 
** including the "materiality" of that representation.
* epistomological point to be made here
** interpretations come from a complex web of knowledge 
*** cultural
*** medical
*** bodily experiences
** i am not really interested in untangling this web
* HOWEVER! we can show diverse effects 
** by changing representation + signal independently
** TODO i bet, neither representation nor signal 100% predicts response
*** if i take a reperesentation
*** vary the signal
*** and see /the same interpretations/
*** i would be dispapointed
* highlights need to show multiple contexts
** TODO importnt not to show differences - 
** TODO but show what might be the /same/ in multiple sensing contexts
** TODO i bet, people undervalue the threat of unknown signals, 
*** and/or make incorrect assumptions about what algorithms can know 
**** companies can exploit to their distinct advantage
* another way of looking at this issue
** what do people /believe/ that sensors or algorithms can tell about you?
*** i can tell you we dont know it
*** but why do we /want/ to know it
**** this is the question that has evaded me...
**** but, was at taqueria la familia a while ago
**** finally came up with an answer while eating my fish taco
**** go figure
** we know what /researchers/ think of this issue!
*** affective computing
*** emotion theory
*** "social physics" & SNA
*** etc...
* but, *what do everyday people think*?
** and, our *reason* for being curious is *disclosure*
*** balancing privacy with benefits
*** hwo/when people give up data will be important 
**** an economic question
**** a medical question
**** potentially political question
