The proliferation of inexpensive, wearable sensors is expanding the realm of the digital, turning our physiologies into data and models. Models of our physiology now can be used to bootstrap algoirthms, which, among other things, purport to detect a user’s state of mind. Will the contents of our own thoughts become data as well, subject to hacking, leaks and inappropriate disclosures? 

In order to discuss how the proliferation of physiological sensor data might affect our privacy, we first must understand how people build interpretations around these data. What do these signals mean, not to algorithms, but to other people? 

A rich body of literature suggests that biosignals can engender feelings of personal disclosure [1, 4], or act as cues that encourage normative social behavior [3]. This work generally configures biosignal sharing as a way to “enhance” social interactions: to increase intimacy between romantic partners [1, 4, 5], or to inspire cooperation in teams [2, 3]. However, little work has looked at how physiological signals could give rise to negative social consequences. While some studies admit that biosignals could create feelings of over-disclosure [4], they do not go into specifics about what this over-disclosure might mean in social settings, or what mechanisms are responsible for causing it. In fact, little work has investigated the mechanisms by which biosignals are able to take on social meanings at all. Now that some consumer devices allow us to share biosensory data socially (e.g. the Apple Watch’s heartrate sharing feature), we must begin to ask how, why, and when social meanings can arise from the transmision biosensory data, and how these meanings vary under different social contexts and in the presence of different social cues. What could a leak of my heartrate data say about me?

GSR funding for Fall 2016 and Spring 2017, plus funding for 300 subject Human-Computerrs in various experimental studies.

> expected outcomes of your work, for the first year.

Studies on how people build interpretations around low-level physiological signals, and especially how these interpretations are subject to different situational contexts. 

Systems by which these signals can be transferred, and software toolkits for prototyping applications that transmit sensor data socially.
