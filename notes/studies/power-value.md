> I wonder if we couldnt introduce certain information for [say] low power actors that might shift the balance [when they interact with high-power actors]. If we could show that experimentally, it would be pretty amazing.

ok, simplest thing that could possibly work:

what if low-power actors saw that high-power actors had a normal, or elevated, heartrate?

depending on when we show it, seeing an elevated heartrate might shift the balance of power by making the high-power actor seem "vulnerable"?Â 

> yes, yes-- exactly. I like the idea of providing this information (heartrate normal/elevated) in an imbalanced context. Does the disadvantaged actor use or interpret the info differently than the other way around? **That is, does the relational context (high/low power, or high/low status, etc) change the interpretation of ambiguous biometric information?**

> that could be pretty sweet.







backstory:

http://www.pnas.org/content/112/42/12950.abstract

put out a new paper on the role of power and trust (essentially showing how low-power actors tend to 'trust' more than higher power actors, based on expectations of hope among other things). This is important in social psych/sociology b/c it tests a fundamental difference between rational choice expectations versus more cognitive approaches.

I bring it up here b/c another very different idea I have been wanting to pursue for a while is to look at a more fundamental social problem (such as power and status as it relates to the emergence of trust), but introduce 'new information' into the interaction equation in the form of "potentially meaningful" biometric information.
