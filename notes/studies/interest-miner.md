here's an idea that's kind of far afield from the stuff we've been talking about:

imagine i put a brainwave scanner on you, and some app flashes a bunch of headlines in front of you. at the end, it shows you which ones you were "most interested in"

i bet this works regardless of any technology stuff -- people will believe they were subconsciously interested, just because the scanner has some kind of charisma about it

> I like this...there is potential for another twist: you could tell the person that the brainwave scanner can only detect 'arousal' or some similarly vague term. Then, the likert-style questions that the participant receives could be used to have them tell *us* what it was detecting (e.g., these are topics I know a lot about...these are issues I care about...) and, same could be done with the things that they were "not aroused by".  

> Obviously this could get into murky territory regarding rationalization, etc...but like the paper you linked, this could be an important part of social interpretations of such info.
