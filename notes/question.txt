WHAT IS THE EXPRESSIVE CAPACITY OF SENSOR DATA?

this is the core question of my dissertation.

Signals from physiological sensors are expressive, and meaningful communication can occur through them. 

1. how do people interpret biosignals they see from other people (the involuntary case)?

2. how do people build narratives around their own data (the involuntary case)?

3. patterns, recipes, the cookbook















are they about state of mind?are we fooling ourselves into some type of telepathy?
to what extent will people believe that a sensor (say, a dinky eeg device) is *capable* of reading their thoughts? [neuroenchantment]
raw signals are easy to experiment with
but algorithms too;and how can people work *with* algorithms to express themselves? differently from how they'd use those data for self-tracking? if differently, why? is it because they think they're disclosing something that they shouldnt be disclosing?
finally, what is the THEORETICAL expressive capacity of sensor data? what can be known about subjective experience through digital sensing of the physiology? this is an incredibly deep question and we will only take a tour of it, through.....


ORDER OF AFFAIRS (?):

1 what is the THEORETICAL expressive capacity of sensor data?  **(not as the question of, oh look im a computer scientist, but as the question of, what do these narratives mean for our understanding of the embodied human experience?)**  if we're interested in monitoring subjective experience, can our surveillance ever be *complete*? if you're a for our strict materialist or non-dualist, you may say the answer is "yes, theoretically." if so, what would the appropriate of measurement be? the individual? the individual's immediate surroundings? their entire society?
what *would* any of thse conclusions mean for our broader understanding/cultural narratives of consciousness/conscious experience? and, can we view the mission of detecting thought as an experimental foray into the materialism first laid out by [...] and continued by [...denett]; or, potentially, a narrative of even deeper complexity of how "mind" (whatever that is) arises from physical tissue ....... much the way sequencing the human genome has......?
( a crazy tour, and something ill REALLY enjoy writing ).
*our point is not to simply philosophize, but to show that answers to these questions, even if they are implicit, have a significant effect on the way devices **could** be designed! and the **ethics** of designing them from a privacy standpoint!*

[ok now connecting this to the following?]

2 to what extent do people read into emotion/state of mind when they see someone's sensor data? what kind of narratives do people build around other people's sensor data? (dark side,,,,how can sensors make people vulnerable?!!?)

3 how does co-operative "labeling" (sense-making) alongside algorithms+other people allow people to have agency when expressing their,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ? (dark side,,,,how can sensors trick people?!)



NICE!!!!!!!!!! NOW *THATS* A DISSERTATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



In case it isn't already clear, I am a skeptic about the claims of ,,,,,,, Not that I think their results are over-hyped, but that I believe their assumptions are reductive insofar as they fail to examine what can be learned *about* subjective experience. [anecdote about the 97% similarity.....well, *WHATS IN THE 3% DIFFERENCE????* you got all the way to the edge of potentially *observing* a *difference* in subjective experience under a controlled setting, and you didnt write it up in your paper, or ever? you just consider it *3% ERROR*? chipanzee DNA is 99.9999% human DNA - *THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED IN THOSE SMALL %!*






HOWEVER, I WILL LIST THESE CHAPTERS IN REVERSE ORDER OF APPEARANCE, AS THEY ARE BETTER INTRODUCED FROM LEAST TO MOST ABSTRACT:


we know that they  communicate different things (doctor versus people)
we know that they  sometimes communicate things to ordinary people, (old hr study)
we know that they  can communicate our emotions to machines (?)

in the most general terms, what are biosensor data CAPABLE OF EXPRESSING? 
both to ordinary people as uninterpreted data
and to humans as machine-, or algorithm-interpreted data?

for the first question, we can rely on theory from embodiment and so on to tred the waters of theoretical explanations. *Any raw physiological signal, sufficiently explained, a person can relate to, via their bodily experiences, and thus project an emotion onto it.*

for the second one, ..... besides the obvious stuff,,avatars? *even though they are not a human *form*, they are *bodily*, in the literal sense but more importantly in the experiental sense.*

well, these are certainly 2 *claims*. will it be the work of my dissertation to defend them?






2 what is the CURRENT expressive power of physiological signals? (in the lab, in ideal conditions, etc). and, more interestingly, what are the latent assumptions of researchers who are working on these algorithms? what do THEY think about consciousness, and how does it align (or fail to align) with (1)?
**bleh this ones kind of a snoozer**



soemday computers will know what you're thinking,
what does this mean




"what youre thinking"
basically "what could the content of this thought be"?
fascinating question, philosophical, mathematical,
to the very core of what can be known. about modelling a system over observation. about virtualization, as in one computer virtualizing another.

"what does this mean"
well here im really taken to task as a social scientist.
what does it mean for our understanding of ourselves?
what does it mean for the way we communicate with others?



1. project with coye.   signals about 'what you are thinking' (whatever that means) could be as simple as 'your heartrate spiked.' IS something that simple enough for MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION TO OCCUR? YES! there is a behavioral outcome. so, this is a fundamentally new kind of communication, plays with our idea of *communicative consent*.
