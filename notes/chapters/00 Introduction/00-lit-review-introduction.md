idea of mediating interpersonal communciation with physiological sensors goes back to the wee days of ubicomp [@picard_affective_1997, @bell_intimate_2003], and more recent work [@slovak_understanding_2012]. 

now that these devices are starting to get a bit more REAL............frame MHEALTH as the driver here, even citing fletcher and so on.

so, NOW we need to ask, is intimacy teh whole story? WHAT IS THE EXPRESSIVE CAPACITY OF SENSORS?
we ask because privacy, security of data depends on understanding what these data MEAN, to PEOPLE who might be tempted to disclose them for a variety of reasons: for healht-related applications, etc.

This is the question that led my to my study................................. We know the meaning of these signals are primed heavily by SOCIAL CONTEXT - where the signals were exchanged, and who the participants were to each other [@slovak_understanding_2012]. <!-- here, past work on perceptions of biosignals: valens, neurohype?
i see valens & neurohype as being quite similar
-->

then, yeah, we learn not at all always positive....its complicated, a highly contextual signal

so thats how we get here, to asking what these signals can express to people

a few fields have studied various parts of this problem, each in slightly different capacities. here, i review three fields: affective computing, as it attempts to condence non-medical meaning from biological signals; the "honest signals" and "social physics" of pentland, as it attempts to use these signals for non-medical purposes; and social exhcange theory, as it attempts to unpack the role of sensors in mediating interpersonal communication in these sorts of applications.
