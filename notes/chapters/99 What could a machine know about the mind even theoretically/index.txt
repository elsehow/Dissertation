#  What is computer-knowable about our subjective experience?

To what extent is the "ground gruth" on matters of the mind simply experiential, subjective, "interior", and to what extent can it be captured by sensors?

At one extreme, you have sensors spying on individual neurons. this is actually a real technology called "neural dust" thats being developed at here at berkeley. But what would this technology actually tell us? How would the surveillance work?

### project: neural network simulator
well, one way of seeing how it would really work, what we could really know from neural dust, is using a neural network - a semi-realistic simulation of a series of neurons, and use a neural-dust simulator (another computer program) that "spies" on the network by observing (semi-)realistic activity while the network learns some task. the question then becomes, what can the spy find out?  can it reverse engineer activity to repreoduce events? what else can it do?

## project: the distinguishability of tasks, and people, in EEG
on the other extreme, there are the items we have today, the familiar physiological sensors...... well, I can certainly do a survey, through our lense of feelings/states of midn that you might _TRANSMIT_ to others - and I can speak about just one corner (though I think an interesting corner), consumer EEG devices.

`((what we could learn from all this))`



## Introduction

"you cant tell emotion from EEG" how do you know? what do we know? what is emotion? do you know? you may think you do, but i can challenge that....`emotion is an intrinsic part of cognition`

do you believe that what you're thinking + feeling is describable as a COMPUTABLE STATE?
if you do, then this becomes a problem about VIRTUALIZING a system by OBSERVING its outputs.

this is a strictly MATERIALIST view. if that offends you, well, you came to class on the wrong day today. its not the only interpretatin. EMBODIED COGNITION many other camps are *not* strict materialists, they have a notion of mind that is *not* a strict subset of material phenomena, and I am not proposing materialism because i think its "THE TRUTH,"  i'm proposing it because i think **strict materialism is what we have to believe if we want to make serious, positivist progress on the question of how sensors can detect what goes on in the mind.** 

if we continue down this strict materialism road for 50 years and we're getting streaming data from your whole body, and we still can't detect longing, then we may actually start to think that this whole "mind" thing is real. and we may have a reason to look back at dualism. but for now we have strict materialism. now, this is a position that has consequences, and tradeoffs in what we can study and assume, and i'll talk about those later, but it gives us something to go off of.

## "Separating" the emotional experience from the body

alright, so the mind. what is it? well, if we're a materialist, we have some neurons and chemicals, we have nerves all over the body in fact, and muscles and ligaments that take inputs from the nerves. some of these muscles/nerves take voluntary input, some don't, sometimes there's some mix of voluntary and involuntary controls. so, where does emotion live in this mess, and how can we get it out of there?

now, does anyone have any problems with this narrative? ....
