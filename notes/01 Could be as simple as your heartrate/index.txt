I'm making the claim:

SOMEDAY, COMPUTERS WILL KNOW WHAT WE'RE THINKING

for some value of "what we're thinking."

in the meantime, I'm making the claim that

SENSORS PROVIDE NEW AVENUES FOR MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION, WHICH HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT CONSENT STRUCTURES FROM "TRADITIONAL" COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

models about what someone is thinking (whatever that means) could be as simple as "your heartrate just spiked." if it IS just this simple, could we make a MEANINGFUL conversation take place? NOT about why you would but about what COULD be done, and what would happen. well, SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN! we see a behavioral outcome. so, this is a new type of communication, not the kind where you type out an SMS and decide to send it, but one where you decide to share a signal and you have NO IDEA whats going to come out! 

from prospectus 8/10

> Let's break these (hypothetical) mind-models into two categories:

> 1. The kind that the sender can see before sending, and form a narrative around.

> 2. The kind that the sender decides to transmit in real-time - that is, the kind where the sender doesn't know exactly what they'll be sending to their partner.

> (1) allows the sender to co-construct a narrative, (2) presents a fundamentally different model of communicative consent, asks the *recepient* to co-construct a narrative.




VIGNETTES

here we're interested in what people READ INTO sensor data

WHAT DOES SOMEONE ELSE'S HEARTRATE SAY ABOUT THEM?

"I'm running late."

with heartrate elevated
with heartrate normal
(no heartrate)



WHAT DOES YOUR HEARTRATE SAY ABOUT YOU?

"I'm running late."

you have the option of sending your heartrate, and you see that it's elevated.

you have the option of sending your heartrate, but you don't know what your heartrate is.



how does this scenario fit in?:

you are going to engage in a conversation with someone you don't know, and they'll be able to see your heartrate in real time.
