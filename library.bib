Overall, strong positive associations emerged among online commenting frequency, trolling enjoyment, and troll identity, pointing to a common construct underlying the measures. Both studies revealed similar patterns of relations between trolling and the Dark Tetrad of personality: trolling correlated positively with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, using both enjoyment ratings and identity scores. Of all personality measures, sadism showed the most robust associations with trolling and, importantly, the relationship was specific to trolling behavior. Enjoyment of other online activities, such as chatting and debating, was unrelated to sadism. Thus cyber-trolling appears to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism.},

With this proof-of-concept phase in the past, the time is now ripe to focus on the development of practical BCI technologies that can be brought out of the lab and into real-world applications. In particular, we focus on the prospect of improving the lives of countless disabled individuals through a combination of BCI technology with existing assistive technologies (AT). In pursuit of more practical BCIs for use outside of the lab, in this paper, we identify four application areas where disabled individuals could greatly benefit from advancements in BCI technology, namely, "Communication and Control", "Motor Substitution", "Entertainment", and "Motor Recovery". We review the current state of the art and possible future developments, while discussing the main research issues in these four areas. In particular, we expect the most progress in the development of technologies such as hybrid BCI architectures, user-machine adaptation algorithms, the exploitation of users' mental states for BCI reliability and confidence measures, the incorporation of principles in human-computer interaction (HCI) to improve BCI usability, and the development of novel BCI technology including better EEG devices.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the feasibility and robustness of an asynchronous and non-invasive EEG-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) for continuous mental control of a wheelchair.
Methods
In experiment 1 two subjects were asked to mentally drive both a real and a simulated wheelchair from a starting point to a goal along a pre-specified path. Here we only report experiments with the simulated wheelchair for which we have extensive data in a complex environment that allows a sound analysis. Each subject participated in five experimental sessions, each consisting of 10 trials. The time elapsed between two consecutive experimental sessions was variable (from 1 h to 2 months) to assess the system robustness over time. The pre-specified path was divided into seven stretches to assess the system robustness in different contexts. To further assess the performance of the brain-actuated wheelchair, subject 1 participated in a second experiment consisting of 10 trials where he was asked to drive the simulated wheelchair following 10 different complex and random paths never tried before.
Results
In experiment 1 the two subjects were able to reach 100\% (subject 1) and 80\% (subject 2) of the final goals along the pre-specified trajectory in their best sessions. Different performances were obtained over time and path stretches, what indicates that performance is time and context dependent. In experiment 2, subject 1 was able to reach the final goal in 80\% of the trials.
Conclusions
The results show that subjects can rapidly master our asynchronous EEG-based BCI to control a wheelchair. Also, they can autonomously operate the BCI over long periods of time without the need for adaptive algorithms externally tuned by a human operator to minimize the impact of EEG non-stationarities. This is possible because of two key components: first, the inclusion of a shared control system between the BCI system and the intelligent simulated wheelchair; second, the selection of stable user-specific EEG features that maximize the separability between the mental tasks.
Significance
These results show the feasibility of continuously controlling complex robotics devices using an asynchronous and non-invasive BCI.},

	abstract = {Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Maintenance of cognitive control is a major concern for many human disease conditions; therefore, a major goal of human neuroprosthetics is to facilitate and/or recover the cognitive function when such circumstances impair appropriate decision making.
APPROACH: Minicolumnar activity from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was recorded from nonhuman primates trained to perform a delayed match to sample (DMS), via custom-designed conformal multielectrode arrays that provided inter-laminar recordings from neurons in the PFC layer 2/3 and layer 5. Such recordings were analyzed via a previously demonstrated nonlinear multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) neuroprosthesis in rodents, which extracted and characterized multicolumnar firing patterns during DMS performance.
MAIN RESULTS: The MIMO model verified that the conformal recorded individual PFC minicolumns responded to entrained target selections in patterns critical for successful DMS performance. This allowed the substitution of task-related layer 5 neuron firing patterns with electrical stimulation in the same recording regions during columnar transmission from layer 2/3 at the time of target selection. Such stimulation improved normal task performance, but more importantly, recovered performance when applied as a neuroprosthesis following the pharmacological disruption of decision making in the same task.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide the first successful application of neuroprosthesis in the primate brain designed specifically to restore or repair the disrupted cognitive function.},

This work intends to build a user-friendly, self-paced Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that allows using commercial EEG headsets in order to drive an electrical wheelchair with a motor imagery approach. Furthermore, the conceived system has been used for a first evaluation of a commercial, low-cost, EEG device compared with data coming from a professional device.

	abstract = {Objective. Current electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring systems typically require cumbersome electrodes that must be pasted on a scalp, making a private recording of an EEG in a public place difficult. We have developed a small, user friendly, biocompatible electrode with a good appearance for inconspicuous EEG monitoring. Approach. We fabricated carbon nanotube polydimethylsiloxane (CNT/PDMS)-based canal-type ear electrodes (CEE) for EEG recording. These electrodes have an additional function, triggering sound stimulation like earphones and recording EEG simultaneously for auditory brain–computer interface (BCI). The electrode performance was evaluated by a standard EEG measurement paradigm, including the detection of alpha rhythms and measurements of N100 auditory evoked potential (AEP), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Furthermore, the bio- and skin-compatibility of CNT/PDMS were tested. Main results. All feasibility studies were successfully recorded with the fabricated electrodes, and the biocompatibility of CNT/PDMS was also proved. Significance. These electrodes could be used to monitor EEG clinically, in ubiquitous health care and in brain–computer interfaces.},

	abstract = {Neural signals are everywhere just like mobile phones. We propose to use neural signals to control mobile phones for hands-free, silent and effortless human-mobile interaction. Until recently, devices for detecting neural signals have been costly, bulky and fragile. We present the design, implementationandevaluationoftheNeuroPhone system, which allows neural signals to drive mobile phone applications on the iPhone using cheap off-the-shelf wireless electroencephalography (EEG) headsets. We demonstrate a brain-controlled address book dialing app, which works on similar principles to P300-speller brain-computer interfaces: the phone flashes a sequence of photos of contacts from the address book and a P300 brain potential is elicited when the flashed photo matches the person whom the user wishes to dial. EEG signals from the headset are transmitted wirelessly to an iPhone, which natively runs a lightweight classifier to discriminate P300 signals from noise. When a person’s contactphoto triggers a P300, his/her phone number is automatically dialed. NeuroPhone breaks new ground as a brainmobile phone interface for ubiquitous pervasive computing. We discuss the challenges in making our initial prototype more practical, robust, and reliable as part of our on-going research. Categories and Subject Descriptors},

However, classifying the EEG signals is not a trivial task due to their non-stationary characteristics. In this paper, we introduce and utilize incremental quantum particle swarm optimization (IQPSO) algorithm for incremental classification of EEG data stream. IQPSO builds the classification model as a set of explicit rules which benefits from semantic symbolic knowledge representation and enhanced comprehensibility. We compared the performance of IQPSO against ten other classifiers on two EEG datasets. The results suggest that IQPSO outperforms other classifiers in terms of classification accuracy, precision and recall.},

Since the characteristics of such direct brain-to-computer interaction are limited in several aspects, one major challenge in BCI research is intelligent front-end design. Here we present the mental text entry application ‘Hex-o-Spell’ which incorporates principles of Human-Computer Interaction research into BCI feedback design. The system utilises the high visual display bandwidth to help compensate for the extremely limited control bandwidth which operates with only two mental states, where the timing of the state changes encodes most of the information. The display is visually appealing, and control is robust. The effectiveness and robustness of the interface was demonstrated at the CeBIT 2006 (world’s largest IT fair) where two subjects operated the mental text entry system at a speed of up to 7.6 char/min.},

The paper investigates the presence of autism using the functional brain connectivity measures derived from electro-encephalogram (EEG) of children during face perception tasks. Approach. Phase synchronized patterns from 128-channel EEG signals are obtained for typical children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The phase synchronized states or synchrostates temporally switch amongst themselves as an underlying process for the completion of a particular cognitive task. We used 12 subjects in each group (ASD and typical) for analyzing their EEG while processing fearful, happy and neutral faces. The minimal and maximally occurring synchrostates for each subject are chosen for extraction of brain connectivity features, which are used for classification between these two groups of subjects. Among different supervised learning techniques, we here explored the discriminant analysis and support vector machine both with polynomial kernels for the classification task. Main results. The leave one out cross-validation of the classification algorithm gives 94.7\% accuracy as the best performance with corresponding sensitivity and specificity values as 85.7\% and 100\% respectively. Significance. The proposed method gives high classification accuracies and outperforms other contemporary research results. The effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of autistic and typical children suggests the possibility of using it on a larger population to validate it for clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Objective. While brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication have reached considerable technical maturity, there is still a great need for state-of-the-art evaluation by the end-users outside laboratory environments. To achieve this primary objective, it is necessary to augment a BCI with a series of components that allow end-users to type text effectively. Approach. This work presents the clinical evaluation of a motor imagery (MI) BCI text-speller, called BrainTree, by six severely disabled end-users and ten able-bodied users. Additionally, we define a generic model of code-based BCI applications, which serves as an analytical tool for evaluation and design. Main results. We show that all users achieved remarkable usability and efficiency outcomes in spelling. Furthermore, our model-based analysis highlights the added value of human-computer interaction techniques and hybrid BCI error-handling mechanisms, and reveals the effects of BCI performances on usability and efficiency in code-based applications. Significance. This study demonstrates the usability potential of code-based MI spellers, with BrainTree being the first to be evaluated by a substantial number of end-users, establishing them as a viable, competitive alternative to other popular BCI spellers. Another major outcome of our model-based analysis is the derivation of a 80\% minimum command accuracy requirement for successful code-based application control, revising upwards previous estimates attempted in the literature.},

We focus on a linear integration of multiple channels for extracting individual components without making any spatial or anatomical modeling assumptions, instead requiring particular statistical properties such as maximum difference, maximum power, or statistical independence. We demonstrate how corresponding algorithms, for example, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis and independent component analysis, can be used to remove eye-motion artifacts, extract strong evoked responses, and decompose temporally overlapping components. The general approach is shown to be consistent with the underlying physics of EEG, which specifies a linear mixing model of the underlying neural and nonneural current sources},

The preparations were: protosubtilin G10x with an activity of 21500 units/g and proteinase immobilized on silochrome C-80 with an activity of 3880 units/g. For protosubtilin G10x the pH optimum was 7.0-7.2. For the immobilized preparation 96-100\% activity was found at pH 5.5-10.0. The difference between the two proteinase preparations was more distinct with respect to the temperature minimum. The initial preparation-protosubtilin G10x was more stable to low temperature and showed maximum activity at 40 degrees; the immobilized preparation was less active at low temperatures and showed maximum activity at 60-70 degrees. Protosubtilin G10x was more sensitive to pH changes, especially in the acid zone (pH 4.5). It was significantly activated at 30-40 degrees and was unstable at 50-60 degrees. The immobilized preparation was activated at 50- 60 degrees and was insensitive to pH changes in the range of 4.5 to 9.2 and temperature changes from 10 degrees to 40 degrees for 1.5-2.0 hours.},

The proposed interface consists of two components: the selection component based on a P300 BCI and the confirmation component based on an SSVEP BCI. Furthermore, the accuracy and selection time models of the interface are built to help analyze the performance of the entire system. Experimental results from 16 participants collected in the laboratory and real driving scenarios show that the average accuracy of the system in the real driving conditions is about 99\% with an average selection time of about 26 s. More importantly, the proposed system improves the accuracy of destination selection compared with a single P300 BCI-based selection system, particularly for those participants with relatively low level of accuracy in using the P300 BCI. This study not only provides individuals with severe motor disabilities with an interface to use intelligent vehicles and thus improve their mobility, but also facilitates the research on driver–vehicle interface, multimodal interaction, and intelligent vehicles. Furthermore, it opens an avenue on how cognitive neuroscience may be applied to intelligent vehicles.},

With Teegi, a user can visualize and analyze his or her own brain activity in real-time, on a tangible character that can be easily manipulated, and with which it is possible to interact. An exploration study has shown that interacting with Teegi seems to be easy, motivating, reliable and infor- mative.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a promising neuroimaging modality for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). So far, most NIRS-based BCI studies have focused on enhancing the accuracy of the classification of different mental tasks. In the present study, we evaluated the performances of a variety of mental task combinations in order to determine the mental task pairs that are best suited for customized NIRS-based BCIs. To this end, we recorded event-related hemodynamic responses while seven participants performed eight different mental tasks. Classification accuracies were then estimated for all possible pairs of the eight mental tasks (C82=28). Based on this analysis, mental task combinations with relatively high classification accuracies frequently included the following three mental tasks: “mental multiplication,” “mental rotation,” and “right-hand motor imagery.” Specifically, mental task combinations consisting of two of these three mental tasks showed the highest mean classification accuracies. It is expected that our results will be a useful reference to reduce the time needed for preliminary tests when discovering individual-specific mental task combinations.},

	abstract = {The long-lasting neuromodulatory effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are of great interest for therapeutic applications in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, due to which functional connectivity among brain regions is profoundly disturbed. Classic TMS studies selectively alter neural activity in specific brain regions and observe neural activity changes on nonperturbed areas to infer underlying connectivity and its changes. Less has been indicated in direct measures of functional connectivity and/or neural network and on how connectivity/network alterations occur. Here, we developed a novel analysis framework to directly investigate both neural activity and connectivity changes induced by rTMS from resting-state EEG (rsEEG) acquired in a group of subjects with a chronic disorder of imbalance, known as the mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS). Resting-state activity in multiple functional brain areas was identified through a data-driven blind source separation analysis on rsEEG data, and the connectivity among them was characterized using a phase synchronization measure. Our study revealed that there were significant long-lasting changes in resting-state neural activity, in theta, low alpha, and high alpha bands and neural networks in theta, low alpha, high alpha and beta bands, over broad cortical areas 4 to 5 h after the last application of rTMS in a consecutive five-day protocol. Our results of rsEEG connectivity further indicated that the changes, mainly in the alpha band, over the parietal and occipital cortices from pre- to post-TMS sessions were significantly correlated, in both magnitude and direction, to symptom changes in this group of subjects with MdDS. This connectivity measure not only suggested that rTMS can generate positive treatment effects in MdDS patients, but also revealed new potential targets for future therapeutic trials to improve treatment effects. It is promising that the new connectivity meas- re from rsEEG can be used to understand the variability in treatment response to rTMS in brain disorders with impaired functional connectivity and, eventually, to determine individually tailored stimulation parameters and treatment procedures in rTMS.},

	abstract = {Objective. As we move through an environment, we are constantly making assessments, judgments and decisions about the things we encounter. Some are acted upon immediately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions—our implicit ‘labeling’ of the world. In this paper, we use physiological correlates of this labeling to construct a hybrid brain–computer interface (hBCI) system for efficient navigation of a 3D environment. Approach. First, we record electroencephalographic (EEG), saccadic and pupillary data from subjects as they move through a small part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate the neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective interest to them. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using semi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to the labeled ones. Finally, the system plots an efficient route to help the subjects visit the ‘similar’ objects it identifies. Main results. We show that by exploiting the subjects’ implicit labeling to find objects of interest instead of exploring naively, the median search precision is increased from 25\% to 97\%, and the median subject need only travel 40\% of the distance to see 84\% of the objects of interest. We also find that the neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers’ inference of subjects’ implicit labeling. Significance. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of objects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting in an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user’s interests.},

The brain-computer interface (BCI) would allow humans to operate computers, wheelchairs, prostheses, and other devices, using brain signals only. BCI research may someday provide a communication channel for patients with severe physical disabilities but intact cognitive functions, a working tool in computational neuroscience that contributes to a better understanding of the brain, and a novel independent interface for human-machine communication that offers new options for monitoring and control. This volume presents a timely overview of the latest BCI research, with contributions from many of the important research groups in the field. The book covers a broad range of topics, describing work on both noninvasive (that is, without the implantation of electrodes) and invasive approaches. Other chapters discuss relevant techniques from machine learning and signal processing, existing software for BCI, and possible applications of BCI research in the real world.},

Yet because of their limited processing and transmission capacities most applications considered to date imply either indoor real-time data streaming, or ambulatory data recording. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using disruption-tolerant wireless sensors to monitor the biomedical parameters of athletes during outdoor sports events. We focus on a scenario we believe to be a most challenging one: the ECG monitoring of runners during a marathon race, using off-the shelf sensing devices and a limited number of base stations deployed along the marathon route. Preliminary experiments conducted during an intra-campus sports event show that such a scenario is indeed viable, although special attention must be paid to supporting episodic, low-rate transmissions between sensors carried by runners and road-side base stations.},

suppression indices for delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4– 8 Hz), mu (8–13 Hz), SMR (13–15 Hz), beta (15–25 Hz), and gamma (35–45 Hz) frequencies were calculated as the ratio of the power during the experimental conditions (viewing of Hand, Crayon, and Social videos) relative to the power during the baseline video condition (Ball). 
 Ratios were used to control for variability in absolute power as a result of individual differences such as scalp thickness etc
Since ratio data are inherently non-normal as a result of lower bounding, a log transform was used for data analysis. A log ratio of less than zero indicates suppression whereas a value of zero indicates no suppression and values greater than zero indicate enhancement.

	abstract = {Detecting interpersonal and emotional aspects of behaviour is a growing area of research within HCI. However, this work primarily processes data from individuals, rather than drawing on the dynamics of an interaction between people. Literature in social psychology and neuroscience suggests that the synchronisation of peoples' biosignals, in particular skin conductance (EDA), can be indicative of complex interpersonal aspects such as empathy. This paper reports on an exploratory, mixed methods study to test the potential of EDA synchronisation to indicate qualities of interpersonal interaction in real-world relationships and contexts. We show that EDA synchrony can be indicate meaningful social aspects in everyday settings, linking it to the mutual emotional engagement of those interacting. This connects to earlier work on empathy in psychotherapy, and suggests new interpretations of EDA sychronisation in other social contexts. We then outline how these findings open opportunities for novel HCI and ubicomp applications, supporting training of social skills such as empathy for doctors, and more generally to explore shared experiences such as multiplayer games.},

Study and control groups were each composed of 66 singletons, 19 pairs of twins and 4 sets of triplets, whose age at examination ranged from 12 to 45 months. The developmental indices of IVF infants were within the normal range and did not differ from those of their matched controls. The indices were positively correlated to gestational age, birth weight, head circumference at birth and at examination, and mother's education. Mean birth weight, gestational age, and birth weight percentile of IVF infants were lower than the mean of the healthy population. Mean percentiles of weight and length at examination (mean age 22.4 months) were equally low but did not differ from those of the matched controls. However, mean percentiles of head circumference at birth and at examination compare well with the normal mean, both in IVF and control groups.

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations were shown to be associated with perceptual, motor and cognitive brain operations. While complex spatio-temporal dynamics are a hallmark of neuronal oscillations, they also represent a formidable challenge for a proper extraction and quantifications of oscillatory activity with non-invasive recording techniques such as EEG and MEG. In order to facilitate the study of neuronal oscillations we present a general purpose pre-processing approach, which can be applied for a wide range of analyses including but not restricted to inverse modeling and multivariate single-trial classification. The idea is to use dimensionality reduction with spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) instead of the commonly and almost exclusively used principal component analysis (PCA). The key advantage of SSD lies in selecting components explaining oscillations-related variance instead of just any variance as in the case of PCA. For the validation of SSD pre-processing we performed extensive simulations with different inverse modeling algorithms and signal-to-noise ratios. In all these simulations SSD invariably outperformed PCA often by a large margin. Moreover, using a database of multichannel EEG recordings from 80 subjects we show that pre-processing with SSD significantly increases the performance of single-trial classification of imagined movements, compared to the classification with PCA pre-processing or without any dimensionality reduction. Our simulations and analysis of real EEG experiments show that, while not being supervised, the SSD algorithm is capable of extracting components primarily relating to the signal of interest often using as little as 20 \% of the data variance, instead of \&gt; 90 \% variance as in case of PCA. Given its ease of use, absence of supervision, and capability to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of multivariate EEG/MEG data, we advocate the application of SSD pre-processing for the analysis of spontaneous and induced neuronal oscillations in normal subjects and patients.},

Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak.},

In particular, it would be advantageous to establish communication with these patients. This work describes a procedure using EEG to detect brain responses to imagery instruction in patients with disorders of consciousness. Five healthy subjects and five patients with different disorders of consciousness took part in the study. A support vector machine classifier applied to EEG data was used to distinguish two mental tasks (Imagery Trial) and to detect answers to simple yes or no questions (pre-Communication Trial). The proposed procedure uses feature selection based on a nested-leave-one-out algorithm to reduce the number of electrodes required. We obtained a mean classification accuracy of 82.0\% (SD 5.1\%) for healthy subjects and 84.6\% (SD 9.1\%) for patients in the Imagery Trial, and a mean classification accuracy of 80.7\% (SD 11.5\%) for healthy subjects and 91.7\% (SD 7.4\%) for patients in the pre-Communication Trial. The subset of electrodes selected was subject and session dependent.},

	abstract = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide non-muscular communication and control for people with severe motor disabilities. Current BCIs use a variety of invasive and non-invasive methods to record brain signals and a variety of signal processing methods. Whatever the recording and processing methods used, BCI performance (e.g. the ability of a BCI to control movement of a computer cursor) is highly variable and, by the standards applied to neuromuscular control, could be described as ataxic. In an effort to understand this imperfection, this paper discusses the relevance of two principles that underlie the brain's normal motor outputs. The first principle is that motor outputs are normally produced by the combined activity of many CNS areas, from the cortex to the spinal cord. Together, these areas produce appropriate control of the spinal motoneurons that activate muscles. The second principle is that the acquisition and life-long preservation of motor skills depends on continual adaptive plasticity throughout the CNS. This plasticity optimizes the control of spinal motoneurons. In the light of these two principles, a BCI may be viewed as a system that changes the outcome of CNS activity from control of spinal motoneurons to, instead, control of the cortical (or other) area whose signals are used by the BCI to determine the user's intent. In essence, a BCI attempts to assign to cortical neurons the role normally performed by spinal motoneurons. Thus, a BCI requires that the many CNS areas involved in producing normal motor actions change their roles so as to optimize the control of cortical neurons rather than spinal motoneurons. The disconcerting variability of BCI performance may stem in large part from the challenge presented by the need for this unnatural adaptation. This difficulty might be reduced, and BCI development might thereby benefit, by adopting a ‘goal-selection’ rather than a ‘process- control’ strategy. In ‘process control’, a BCI manages all the intricate high-speed interactions involved in movement. In ‘goal selection’, by contrast, the BCI simply communicates the user's goal to software that handles the high–speed interactions needed to achieve the goal. Not only is ‘goal selection’ less demanding, but also, by delegating lower-level aspects of motor control to another structure (rather than requiring that the cortex do everything), it more closely resembles the distributed operation characteristic of normal motor control.},

	abstract = {Lung function was measured at 30 minutes and again at 2 hours after birth in 12 infants delivered vaginally, in 15 infants delivered by elective caesarean section under general anaesthesia (GA), and in 15 delivered under epidural anesthesia (EDA). Umbilical arterial blood was analysed for pH and for concentrations of catecholamines and cortisol. No important differences in gestational age, birthweight, Apgar scores, or haematocrit were found among the three groups. Tidal volume and minute ventilation measured 30 minutes after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered vaginally and at 2 hours the tidal volume was still lower in the babies delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered vaginally. Dynamic compliance was lower at 30 minutes in the group that had a caesarean section than in the vaginal group, and this difference was significant at two hours. Tidal volume, minute ventilation, and dynamic compliance in the GA and EDA groups did not differ. The catecholamine and cortisol concentrations at birth were higher in the vaginal group than in the group delivered by caesarean section. Two hours after birth there was a significant correlation (r = 0.84) between the catecholamine concentrations of the infants born vaginally and lung compliance. The lower dynamic lung compliance in infants delivered by elective caesarean section might be explained by delayed absorption of liquid in the lung due to lack of catecholamine surge.},

	abstract = {Objective. Abundant literature suggests the use of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) in a wide spectrum of basic and applied neuroscience areas. Due to their low signal to noise ratio, these potentials are often studied using grand-average analysis, which conceals trial-to-trial information. Moreover, most of the single trial analysis methods in the literature are based on classical electroencephalogram (EEG) features ([1–30] Hz) and are likely to be unsuitable for SCPs that have different signal properties (such as having the signal's spectral content in the range [0.2–0.7] Hz). In this paper we provide insights into the selection of appropriate parameters for spectral and spatial filtering. Approach. We study anticipation related SCPs recorded using a web-browser application protocol and a full-band EEG (FbEEG) setup from 11 subjects on two different days. Main results. We first highlight the role of a bandpass with [0.1–1.0] Hz in comparison with common practices (e.g., either with full dc, just a lowpass, or with a minimal highpass cut-off around 0.05 Hz). Secondly, we suggest that a combination of spatial-smoothing filter and common average reference (CAR) is more suitable than the spatial filters often reported in the literature (e.g., re-referencing to an electrode, Laplacian or CAR alone). Thirdly, with the help of these preprocessing steps, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of linear classifiers across several days (AUC of 0.88 ± 0.05 on average with a minimum of 0.81 ± 0.03 and a maximum of 0.97 ± 0.01). We also report the possibility of further improvements using a Bayesian fusion technique applied to electrode-specific classifiers. Significance. We believe the suggested spatial and spectral preprocessing methods are advantageous for grand-average and single trial analysis of SCPs obtained from EEG, MEG as well as for electrocorticogram. The use of these methods will impact basic neurophysiological studies as well as the use of SCPs in the design of neuroprosthetics.},

	abstract = {In a typical multi-person social interaction, spatial information plays an important role in analyzing the structure of the social interaction. Previous studies, which analyze spatial structure of the social interaction using one or more third-person view cameras, suffer from the occlusion problem. With the increasing popularity of wearable computing devices, we are now able to obtain natural first-person observations with limited occlusion. However, such observations have a limited field of view, and can only capture a portion of the social interaction. To overcome the aforementioned limitation, we propose a search-based structure recovery method in a small group conversational social interaction scenario to reconstruct the social interaction structure from multiple first-person views, where each of them contributes to the multifaceted understanding of the social interaction. We first map each first-person view to a local coordinate system, then a set of constraints and spatial relationships are extracted from these local coordinate systems. Finally, the human spatial configuration is searched under the constraints to ``best'' match the extracted relationships. The proposed method is much simpler than full 3D reconstruction, and suffices for capturing the social interaction spatial structure. Experiments for both simulated and real-world data show the efficacy of the proposed method.},

We undertake an experimental study of the usability and performance of user authentication using consumer-grade EEG sensor technology. By choosing custom tasks and custom acceptance thresholds for each subject, we can achieve 99\% authentication accuracy using single-channel EEG signals, which is on par with previous research employing multi-channel EEG signals using clinical-grade devices. In addition to the usability improvement offered by the single-channel dry-contact EEG sensor, we also study the usability of different classes of mental tasks. We find that subjects have little difficulty recalling chosen “pass-thoughts” (e.g., their previously selected song to sing in their mind). They also have different preferences for tasks based on the perceived difficulty and enjoyability of the tasks. These results can inform the design of authentication systems that guide users in choosing tasks that are both usable and secure.},

Compared to traditional gel-based multi-sensor EEG systems, a dry sensor proves to be more convenient, comfortable and cost effective. A hardware system was built that displays four LED light panels flashing at different frequencies and synchronizes with EEG acquisition. The visual stimuli have been carefully designed such that potential risk to photosensitive people is minimized. We describe a novel stimulus-locked inter-trace correlation (SLIC) method for SSVEP classification using EEG time-locked to stimulus onsets. We studied how the performance of the algorithm is affected by different selection of parameters. Using the SLIC method, the average light detection rate is 75.8\% with very low error rates (an 8.4\% false positive rate and a 1.3\% misclassification rate). Compared to a traditional frequency-domain-based method, the SLIC method is more robust (resulting in less annoyance to the users) and is also suitable for irregular stimulus patterns.},

In just three decades, functional neuroimaging has been transformed from a crude clinical tool to a widely used research method for understanding the human brain and mind. Such rapidly achieved success is bound to evoke skepticism. A degree of skepticism toward new methods and ideas is both inevitable and useful in any field. It is especially valuable in a science as young as cognitive neuroscience and its even younger siblings, social and affective neuroscience. Healthy skepticism encourages us to check our assumptions, recognize the limitations of our methods, and proceed thoughtfully. Skepticism itself, however, also must be examined. In this article, I review the most commonly voiced criticisms of functional neuroimaging. In the spirit of healthy skepticism, I will critically examine these criticisms themselves. Each contains at least a kernel of truth, although I will argue that in some cases the kernel has been overextended in ways that are inaccurate or misleading.},

	abstract = {AbstractObjectives
Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments, but also by patients and end-users, controlling applications in their homes or clinics, without the BCI experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications – like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots – requires a good level of BCI control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train naïve end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications?
Materials and methods
In this work, we report our experiences of training 24 motor-disabled participants at rehabilitation clinics or at the end-users’ homes, without BCI experts present. We also share the lessons that we have learned through transferring BCI technologies from the lab to the user's home or clinics.
Results
The most important outcome is that 50\% of the participants achieved good BCI performance and could successfully control the applications (tele-presence robot and text-entry system). In the case of the tele-presence robot the participants achieved an average performance ratio of 0.87 (max. 0.97) and for the text entry application a mean of 0.93 (max. 1.0). The lessons learned and the gathered user feedback range from pure BCI problems (technical and handling), to common communication issues among the different people involved, and issues encountered while controlling the applications.
Conclusion
The points raised in this paper are very widely applicable and we anticipate that they might be faced similarly by other groups, if they move on to bringing the BCI technology to the end-user, to home environments and towards application prototype control.},

	abstract = {Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues.},

	abstract = {Classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a sophisticated task that determines the accuracy of thought pattern recognition performed by computer-brain interface (BCI) which, in turn, determines the degree of naturalness of the interaction provided by that system. However, classifying the EEG signals is not a trivial task due to their non-stationary characteristics. In this paper, we introduce and utilize incremental quantum particle swarm optimization (IQPSO) algorithm for incremental classification of EEG data stream. IQPSO builds the classification model as a set of explicit rules which benefits from semantic symbolic knowledge representation and enhanced comprehensibility. We compared the performance of IQPSO against ten other classifiers on two EEG datasets. The results suggest that IQPSO outperforms other classifiers in terms of classification accuracy, precision and recall.},

It was also synthesized enzymatically from OH-Dap by a cell-free preparation from this strain. All other Vibrio strains examined also showed the ability to synthesize this compound, but none of the non-vibrio organisms did, indicating that OH-Dap is an in vivo substrate for the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of norspermidine characteristically present in vibrios.

	abstract = {Most P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches use the visual modality for stimulation. For use with patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) this might not be the preferable choice because of sight deterioration. Moreover, using a modality different from the visual one minimizes interference with possible visual feedback. Therefore, a multi-class BCI paradigm is proposed that uses spatially distributed, auditory cues. Ten healthy subjects participated in an offline oddball task with the spatial location of the stimuli being a discriminating cue. Experiments were done in free field, with an individual speaker for each location. Different inter-stimulus intervals of 1000 ms, 300 ms and 175 ms were tested. With averaging over multiple repetitions, selection scores went over 90\% for most conditions, i.e., in over 90\% of the trials the correct location was selected. One subject reached a 100\% correct score. Corresponding information transfer rates were high, up to an average score of 17.39 bits/minute for the 175 ms condition (best subject 25.20 bits/minute). When presenting the stimuli through a single speaker, thus effectively canceling the spatial properties of the cue, selection scores went down below 70\% for most subjects. We conclude that the proposed spatial auditory paradigm is successful for healthy subjects and shows promising results that may lead to a fast BCI that solely relies on the auditory sense.},

	abstract = {AbstractObjectives
Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments, but also by patients and end-users, controlling applications in their homes or clinics, without the BCI experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications – like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots – requires a good level of BCI control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train naïve end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications?
Materials and methods
In this work, we report our experiences of training 24 motor-disabled participants at rehabilitation clinics or at the end-users’ homes, without BCI experts present. We also share the lessons that we have learned through transferring BCI technologies from the lab to the user's home or clinics.
Results
The most important outcome is that 50\% of the participants achieved good BCI performance and could successfully control the applications (tele-presence robot and text-entry system). In the case of the tele-presence robot the participants achieved an average performance ratio of 0.87 (max. 0.97) and for the text entry application a mean of 0.93 (max. 1.0). The lessons learned and the gathered user feedback range from pure BCI problems (technical and handling), to common communication issues among the different people involved, and issues encountered while controlling the applications.
Conclusion
The points raised in this paper are very widely applicable and we anticipate that they might be faced similarly by other groups, if they move on to bringing the BCI technology to the end-user, to home environments and towards application prototype control.},

We focus on a linear integration of multiple channels for extracting individual components without making any spatial or anatomical modeling assumptions, instead requiring particular statistical properties such as maximum difference, maximum power, or statistical independence. We demonstrate how corresponding algorithms, for example, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis and independent component analysis, can be used to remove eye-motion artifacts, extract strong evoked responses, and decompose temporally overlapping components. The general approach is shown to be consistent with the underlying physics of EEG, which specifies a linear mixing model of the underlying neural and non-neural current sources.},

	abstract = {While recent research on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) has highlighted their potential for many applications, they remain barely used outside laboratories. The main reason is their lack of robustness. Indeed, with current BCI, mental state recognition is usually slow and often incorrect. Spontaneous BCI (i.e., mental imagery-based BCI) often rely on mutual learning efforts by the user and the machine, with BCI users learning to produce stable ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) patterns (spontaneous BCI control being widely acknowledged as a skill) while the computer learns to automatically recognize these EEG patterns, using signal processing. Most research so far was focused on signal processing, mostly neglecting the human in the loop. However, how well the user masters the BCI skill is also a key element explaining BCI robustness. Indeed, if the user is not able to produce stable and distinct EEG patterns, then no signal processing algorithm would be able to recognize them. Unfortunately, despite the importance of BCI training protocols, they have been scarcely studied so far, and used mostly unchanged for years. In this paper, we advocate that current human training approaches for spontaneous BCI are most likely inappropriate. We notably study instructional design literature in order to identify the key requirements and guidelines for a successful training procedure that promotes a good and efficient skill learning. This literature study highlights that current spontaneous BCI user training procedures satisfy very few of these requirements and hence are likely to be suboptimal. We therefore identify the flaws in BCI training protocols according to instructional design principles, at several levels: in the instructions provided to the user, in the tasks he/she has to perform, and in the feedback provided. For each level, we propose new research directions that are theoretically expected to address some of these flaws and to help users learn the BCI skill more efficiently.},

Nevertheless, the design of a SMR-based BCI system that provides every user with a reliable BCI control from the first session, i.e., without extensive training, is still a big challenge. Considerable advances in this direction have been made by the machine learning co-adaptive calibration approach, which combines online adaptation techniques with subject learning in order to offer the user a feedback from the beginning of the experiment. Recently, based on offline analyses, we proposed the novel Common Spatial Patterns Patches (CSPP) technique as a good candidate to improve the co-adaptive calibration. CSPP is an ensemble of localized spatial filters, each of them optimized on subject-specific data by CSP analysis. Here, the evaluation of CSPP in online operation is presented for the first time. Results on three BCI-naive participants show indeed promising results. All three users reach the threshold criterion of 70\% accuracy within one session, even one candidate for whom the weak SMR at rest predicted deficient BCI control. Concurrent recordings of the SMR during a relax condition as well as the course of BCI performance indicate a clear learning effect.},

While it is ineffective in most patients, especially those with widespread metastatic disease, it occasionally produces good results. Each of the available methods has inherent problems and, recently, attempts have been made to overcome some of these. There is a strong case for small-scale experimental trials in highly selected groups of patients who are intensively investigated for their immunologic status in relation to their tumour. Despite the lack of success in general, immunotherapy still appears to have a future as an adjunct to existing therapy in order to control as much as to cure residual tumour.},

The key element is that mental tasks are performed through complex spatio-temporal brain processes and they can be better understood only if we model properly the spatio-/spectro temporal data that measures these processes. The proposed methodology is based on a recently proposed novel spiking neural network architecture, called NeuCube as a general framework for spatio-temporal brain data modelling. The methodology is demonstrated on benchmark cognitive EEG data. The new approach leads to a faster data processing, improved accuracy of the EEG data classification and improved understanding of this data and the cognitive processes that generated it. The paper concluded that the new methodology is worth exploring further on other spatio-temporal data, measuring complex cognitive brain processes, aiming at using this method for the development of the next generation of brain–computer interfaces-, of systems for early diagnosis of degenerative brain disease, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and for personalised neuro-rehabilitation systems.},

@misc{_lit_????,
	title = {lit review on backpropogation},
	abstract = {Who invented backpropagation?

Efficient backpropagation (BP) is central to the ongoing Neural Network (NN) ReNNaissance and "Deep Learning."  Who invented it?

It is easy to find misleading accounts of BP's history. I had a look at the original papers from the 1960s and 70s, and talked to BP pioneers. Here is a summary derived from my recent survey, which has additional references:

The minimisation of errors through gradient descent (Hadamard, 1908) in the parameter space of complex, nonlinear, differentiable, multi-stage, NN-related systems has been discussed at least since the early 1960s (e.g., Kelley, 1960; Bryson, 1961; Bryson and Denham, 1961; Pontryagin et al., 1961; Dreyfus, 1962; Wilkinson, 1965; Amari, 1967; Bryson and Ho, 1969; Director and Rohrer, 1969), initially within the framework of Euler-LaGrange equations in the Calculus of Variations (e.g., Euler, 1744).

Steepest descent in the weight space of such systems can be performed (Bryson, 1961; Kelley, 1960; Bryson and Ho, 1969) by iterating the chain rule (Leibniz, 1676; L'Hopital, 1696) à la Dynamic Programming (DP, Bellman, 1957). A simplified derivation of this backpropagation method uses the chain rule only (Dreyfus, 1962).

The systems of the 1960s were already efficient in the DP sense. However, they backpropagated derivative information through standard Jacobian matrix calculations from one "layer" to the previous one, without explicitly addressing either direct links across several layers or potential additional efficiency gains due to network sparsity (but perhaps such enhancements seemed obvious to the authors).

Explicit, efficient error backpropagation (BP) in arbitrary, discrete, possibly sparsely connected, NN-like networks apparently was first described in a 1970 master's thesis (Linnainmaa, 1970, 1976), albeit without reference to NNs. BP is also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation (e.g., Griewank, 2012), where the costs of forward activation spreading essentially equal the costs of backward derivative calculation. See early BP FORTRAN code (Linnainmaa, 1970) and closely related work (Ostrovskii et al., 1971).

BP was soon explicitly used to minimize cost functions by adapting control parameters (weights) (Dreyfus, 1973). This was followed by some preliminary, NN-specific discussion (Werbos, 1974, section 5.5.1), and a computer program for automatically deriving and implementing BP for any given differentiable system (Speelpenning, 1980).

To my knowledge, the first NN-specific application of efficient BP as above was described in 1981 (Werbos, 1981). Related work was published several years later (Parker, 1985; LeCun, 1985). A paper of 1986 significantly contributed to the popularisation of BP for NNs (Rumelhart et al., 1986).

Compare also the first adaptive, deep, multilayer perceptrons (Ivakhnenko et al., since 1965), whose layers are incrementally grown and trained by regression analysis. A paper of 1971 already described a deep GMDH network with 8 layers (Ivakhnenko, 1971).
Compare also a more recent method for multilayer threshold NNs (Bobrowski, 1978).

Technological advancements in the sensor and network communication technology allowed EEG collection during interaction with low obtrusiveness levels as opposed to earlier work which classified physiological signals as the most obtrusive modality in affective analysis. The current article provides a critical survey of research work dealing with broadly affective analysis of EEG signals collected during natural or naturalistic interaction. It focuses on sensors that allow such natural interaction (namely NeuroSky and Emotiv), related technological features and affective aspects of applications in several application domains. These aspects include emotion representation approach, induction method and stimuli and annotation chosen for the application. Additionally, machine learning issues related to affective analysis (such as incorporation of multiple modalities and related issues, feature selection for dimensionality reduction and classification architectures) are revised. Finally, future directions of EEG incorporation in affective and natural interaction are discussed.},

It, thus, allows for nonstationarities in the joint process over cognitive state and generated EEG which may occur during a consecutive number of trials. Nonstationarities may have technical reasons (e.g., changes in impedance between scalp and electrodes) or be caused by learning effects in subjects. We compare the performance of the proposed method against an equivalent static classifier by estimating the generalization accuracy and the bit rate of the BCI. Using data from two studies with healthy subjects, we conclude that adaptive classification significantly improves BCI performance. Averaging over all subjects that participated in the respective study, we obtain, depending on the cognitive task pairing, an increase both in generalization accuracy and bit rate of up to 8\%. We may, thus, conclude that adaptive inference can play a significant contribution in the quest of increasing bit rates and robustness of current BCI technology. This is especially true since the proposed algorithm can be applied in real time.},

	abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows its users to control external devices with brain activity. Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.},

	abstract = {Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

	abstract = {This thesis addresses the problem of managing interruptions from computing devices and appliances in a Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) environment. One way of ap-proaching this problem is through the use of Attentive User Interfaces (AUIs). AUIs sense the users ’ attention for objects and people in their environment, in order to avoid today’s ubiquitous patterns of interruption. However, current AUIs depend on overt measurements of user attention, such as eye contact, which may not always accurately indicate a user’s availability for notifications or interruptions. Although overt measures of user attention may tell us that a user is performing a given task, they do not necessarily indicate the covert state of mind of the user. This thesis presents an experimental study to develop a novel physiological model of interrupt-ability for outside communications that is based upon the user’s internal state which is independent of the user’s current task. These models of attention are the basis of Physiologically Attentive User Interfaces (PAUIs), novel interfaces that are physio-logically aware of the user’s state of mind. PAUIs mediate interruptions reaching the user to automate the regulation of mental load. A number of PAUIs were developed, including the Physiological Weblog, or ’Plog, a PAUI web application which uses the novel interruptability model to automate the communication of attentive information to others. i Acknowledgments I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Roel Vertegaal for his guidance and insight.

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) holds promise as a neuroimaging technology that can be used to understand how the human brain functions in real-world, operational settings while individuals move freely in perceptually-rich environments. In recent years, several EEG systems have been developed that aim to increase the usability of the neuroimaging technology in real-world settings. Here, the usability of three wireless EEG systems from different companies are compared to a conventional wired EEG system, BioSemi’s ActiveTwo, which serves as an established laboratory-grade ‘gold standard’ baseline. The wireless systems compared include Advanced Brain Monitoring’s B-Alert X10, Emotiv Systems’ EPOC and the 2009 version of QUASAR’s Dry Sensor Interface 10–20. The design of each wireless system is discussed in relation to its impact on the system’s usability as a potential real-world neuroimaging system. Evaluations are based on having participants complete a series of cognitive tasks while wearing each of the EEG acquisition systems. This report focuses on the system design, usability factors and participant comfort issues that arise during the experimental sessions. In particular, the EEG systems are assessed on five design elements: adaptability of the system for differing head sizes, subject comfort and preference, variance in scalp locations for the recording electrodes, stability of the electrical connection between the scalp and electrode, and timing integration between the EEG system, the stimulus presentation computer and other external events.},

Most recent BCI studies have demonstrated that the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a powerful tool in extracting features for multiple-class motor imagery. However, since the CSP algorithm requires multi-channel information, it is not suitable for a few- or single-channel system. In this study, we applied a short-time Fourier transform to decompose a single-channel electroencephalography signal into the time-frequency domain and construct multi-channel information. Using the reconstructed data, the CSP was combined with a support vector machine to obtain high classification accuracies from channels of both the sensorimotor and forehead areas. These results suggest that motor imagery can be detected with a single channel not only from the traditional sensorimotor area but also from the forehead area.},

Two surveys conducted a year apart at a large U.S. university, complemented with in-depth interviews with 18 Facebook users, provide the study data. Intensity of Facebook use in year one strongly predicted bridging social capital outcomes in year two, even after controlling for measures of self-esteem and satisfaction with life. These latter psychological variables were also strongly associated with social capital outcomes. Self-esteem served to moderate the relationship between Facebook usage intensity and bridging social capital: those with lower self-esteem gained more from their use of Facebook in terms of bridging social capital than higher self-esteem participants. We suggest that Facebook affordances help reduce barriers that lower self-esteem students might experience in forming the kinds of large, heterogeneous networks that are sources of bridging social capital.},

Here we present data-driven analysis strategies that help to obtain interpretable results from multisubject neuroimaging data when complex movie stimuli are used. These analyses a) enable localization and visualization of brain activity using standard statistical parametric maps in the subspace of brain activity shared between subjects and b) facilitate interpretation of intersubject correlations.

What makes social network sites unique is not that they allow individuals to meet strangers, but rather that they enable users to articulate and make visible their social networks. This can result in connections between individuals that would not other- wise be made, but that is often not the goal, and these meetings are frequently between ‘‘latent ties’’ (Haythornthwaite, 2005) who share some offline connection.

We undertake an experimental study of the usability and performance of user authentication using consumer-grade EEG sensor technology. By choosing custom tasks and custom acceptance thresholds for each subject, we can achieve 99\% authentication accuracy using single-channel EEG signals, which is on par with previous research employing multi-channel EEG signals using clinical-grade devices. In addition to the usability improvement offered by the single-channel dry-contact EEG sensor, we also study the usability of different classes of mental tasks. We find that subjects have little difficulty recalling chosen “pass-thoughts” (e.g., their previously selected song to sing in their mind). They also have different preferences for tasks based on the perceived difficulty and enjoyability of the tasks. These results can inform the design of authentication systems that guide users in choosing tasks that are both usable and secure.},

	abstract = {This study implemented a systematic user-centered training protocol for a 4-class brain-computer interface (BCI). The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially naïve to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84\% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93\% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users.},

replaces the offline calibration by a ‘co-adaptive calibration’, in which the mental strategy of the user and the algorithm of the BCI system are jointly optimized. This approach leads completely novices users to achieve control of the system in just one session (and in the first minutes of operation). In addition, at least half of the category III users, who could not gain BCI control in the classic machine learning approach, could achieve control after 15 min of feedback (after the first run), thus reducing the percentage of users unable to communicate using SMR-based BCI systems from 25\% to 12.5\%.

	abstract = {Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues.},

	abstract = {Monitoring human brain activity has great potential in helping us understand the functioning of our brain, as well as in preventing mental disorders and cognitive decline and improve our quality of life. Non-invasive surface EEG is the dominant modality for studying brain dynamics and performance in real-life interaction of humans with their environment. To take full advantage of surface EEG recordings, EEG technology has to be advanced to a level that it can be used in daily life activities. Furthermore, users have to see it as an unobtrusive option to monitor and improve their health. To achieve this, EEG systems have to be transformed from stationary, wired and cumbersome systems used mostly in clinical practice today, to intelligent wearable, wireless, convenient and comfortable lifestyle solutions that provide high signal quality. Here we discuss state-of-the-art in wireless and wearable EEG solutions and a number of aspects where such solutions require improvements when handling electrical activity of the brain. We address personal traits and sensory inputs, brain signal generation and acquisition, brain signal analysis and feedback generation. We provide guidelines on how these aspects can be advanced further such that we can develop intelligent wearable, wireless, lifestyle EEG solutions. We recognized the following aspects as the ones that need rapid research progress: application driven design, enduser driven development, standardization and sharing of EEG data and development of sophisticated approaches to handle EEG artifacts.},

	abstract = {Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) have gained significant interest over the last decade as viable means of human machine interaction. Although many methods exist to measure brain activity in theory, Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most used method due to the cost efficiency and ease of use. However, thought pattern based control using EEG signals is difficult due two main reasons; 1) EEG signals are highly noisy and contain many outliers, 2) EEG signals are high dimensional. Therefore the contribution of this paper is a novel methodology for recognizing thought patterns based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM). The presented thought recognition methodology is a three step process which utilizes SOM for unsupervised clustering of pre-processed EEG data and feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification. The presented method was tested on 5 different users for identifying two thought patterns; “move forward” and “rest”. EEG Data acquisition was carried out using the Emotiv EPOC headset which is a low cost, commercial-off-the-shelf, noninvasive EEG signal measurement device. The presented method was compared with classification of EEG data using ANN alone. The experimental results for the 5 users chosen showed an improvement of 8\% over ANN based classification.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop methods for simultaneously acquiring electrophysiological data during high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) using high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG). Previous studies have pointed to the after-effects of tDCS on both motor and cognitive performance, and there appears to be potential for using tDCS in a variety of clinical applications. However, little is known about the real-time effects of tDCS on rhythmic cortical activity in humans due to the technical challenges of simultaneously obtaining electrophysiological data during ongoing stimulation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of tDCS in humans are not well understood. We have conducted a simultaneous tDCS–EEG study in a group of healthy human subjects. Significant acute and persistent changes in spontaneous neural activity and event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed during and after the application of high-definition tDCS over the left sensorimotor cortex. Both anodal and cathodal stimulation resulted in acute global changes in broadband cortical activity which were significantly different than the changes observed in response to sham stimulation. For the group of eight subjects studied, broadband individual changes in spontaneous activity during stimulation were apparent both locally and globally. In addition, we found that high-definition tDCS of the left sensorimotor cortex can induce significant ipsilateral and contralateral changes in event-related desynchronization and ERS during motor imagination following the end of the stimulation period. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring high-resolution EEG during high-definition tDCS and provide evidence that tDCS in humans directly modulates rhythmic cortical synchronization during and after its administration.},

	abstract = {This article explores the use of single-channel single-trial EEG signals for natural control of prosthetic hand grasp. It is natural in the sense of that the desired movement is what the subject intends to do. The motor tasks to be intended are the imagination of hand grasping and opening. For prosthetic hand grasp control, the discrimination of the resting state and the imagined voluntary movement is important that has been disregarded in the research area of BCI. This work provides a design for discriminating the resting state and the motor task imagery. To date most researchers have designed and test BCI system on normal subjects. In this work, the experiments were conducted on people with severe physical disabilities. One of the major problem in developing real-time BCI is the eye blink suppression. In this work, the eye blink artifact is suppressed by a neural adaptive noise canceller. This is a concern in real time application. We employ the multilayer perceptron with back-propagation learning rule for EEG classification. Preliminary results indicate that the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns at primary motor cortex and occipito-temporal recording sites is higher than that at other sites. An average correct classification rate of 83\% is achieved using samples of the single-channel EEG signal.},

	abstract = {Sustained, long-term cognitive workload is associated with variations and decrements in performance. Such fluctuations in vigilance can be a risk factor especially during dangerous attention demanding activities. Functional MRI studies have shown that attentional performance is correlated with BOLD-signals, especially in parietal and prefrontal cortical regions. An interesting question is whether these BOLD-signals could be measured in real-world scenarios, say to warn in a dangerous workplace whenever a subjects' vigilance is low. Because fMRI lacks the mobility needed for such applications, we tested whether the monitoring of vigilance might be possible using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS is a highly mobile technique that measures hemodynamics in the surface of the brain. We demonstrate that non-invasive NIRS signals correlate with vigilance. These signals carry enough information to decode subjects' reaction times at a single trial level.},

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations were shown to be associated with perceptual, motor and cognitive brain operations. While complex spatio-temporal dynamics are a hallmark of neuronal oscillations, they also represent a formidable challenge for a proper extraction and quantifications of oscillatory activity with non-invasive recording techniques such as EEG and MEG. In order to facilitate the study of neuronal oscillations we present a general purpose pre-processing approach, which can be applied for a wide range of analyses including but not restricted to inverse modeling and multivariate single-trial classification. The idea is to use dimensionality reduction with spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) instead of the commonly and almost exclusively used principal component analysis (PCA). The key advantage of SSD lies in selecting components explaining oscillations-related variance instead of just any variance as in the case of PCA. For the validation of SSD pre-processing we performed extensive simulations with different inverse modeling algorithms and signal-to-noise ratios. In all these simulations SSD invariably outperformed PCA often by a large margin. Moreover, using a database of multichannel EEG recordings from 80 subjects we show that pre-processing with SSD significantly increases the performance of single-trial classification of imagined movements, compared to the classification with PCA pre-processing or without any dimensionality reduction. Our simulations and analysis of real EEG experiments show that, while not being supervised, the SSD algorithm is capable of extracting components primarily relating to the signal of interest often using as little as 20 \% of the data variance, instead of \&gt; 90 \% variance as in case of PCA. Given its ease of use, absence of supervision, and capability to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of multivariate EEG/MEG data, we advocate the application of SSD pre-processing for the analysis of spontaneous and induced neuronal oscillations in normal subjects and patients.},

	abstract = {Social network sites, online games, video-sharing sites, and gadgets such as iPods and mobile phones are now fixtures of youth culture. They have so permeated young lives that it is hard to believe that less than a decade ago these technologies barely existed. Today's youth may be coming of age and struggling for autonomy and identity as did their predecessors, but they are doing so amid new worlds for communication, friendship, play, and self-expression. This white paper summarizes the results of a three-year ethnographic study, funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, examining young people's participation in the new media ecology. It represents a condensed version of a longer treatment of the project findings. The study was motivated by two primary research questions: How are new media being integrated into youth practices and agendas? How do these practices change the dynamics of youth-adult negotiations over literacy, learning, and authoritative knowledge? Summary of the Study is appended. (Contains 3 figures and 66 notes.)

Our sample included two boyfriend/girlfriend pairs. Among these couples we found a pattern of visual sharing that differed somewhat from how images were shared between peers. Like the peer group, couples also enjoyed sharing special and extraordinary visual information. But we also found that they posted images much more frequently, and that they were more likely to post very mundane photos that conveyed ambient visual information rather than explicit communication. 
 
snapchat?
 
 



he titles of the photos were straightforward: “Rehearsal,” “Snack Booth,” “Opening,” “Break Room.” There is no urgency to the sharing, but if her boyfriend cares to check up on what she is up to, he can get a sense of her current state. 



 


},
	annote = {


The relational outcome of these ongoing intimate exchanges of visual information is that couples have an ambient, shared visual context that they are jointly aware of even when they are physically apart. 
 
now THATS a thought to chew on

We introduce the overall paradigm for our multimodal system that aims at recognizing its users' emotions and at responding to them accordingly depending upon the current context or application. We then describe the design of the emotion elicitation experiment we conducted by collecting, via wearable computers, physiological signals from the autonomic nervous system (galvanic skin response, heart rate, temperature) and mapping them to certain emotions (sadness, anger, fear, surprise, frustration, and amusement). We show the results of three different supervised learning algorithms that categorize these collected signals in terms of emotions, and generalize their learning to recognize emotions from new collections of signals. We finally discuss possible broader impact and potential applications of emotion recognition for multimodal intelligent systems.},

Naturalistic and complex (e.g. movie) stimuli are increasingly used in empirical research but their analysis often relies on considerable human efforts to label or extract stimulus features. Here we present data-driven analysis strategies that help to obtain interpretable results from multisubject neuroimaging data when complex movie stimuli are used. These analyses a) enable localization and visualization of brain activity using standard statistical parametric maps in the subspace of brain activity shared between subjects and b) facilitate interpretation of intersubject correlations. We show experimental results obtained from 50 subjects.},
